I keep killin' my cell mates
Nat Sherman Havana Ovals  Give me those
I would like to open a company that sells cutting boards
Actually I have already finalized it. We will be called Mister Band. It is a good, honest name that people can believe in. What?

So be it.
Oh I worked in a thick layer of "pomade" which is maily a hair product of image conscious black gentlemen

I made it out of raisins that I fermented in a jar
Well Ray It is very potent stuff so perhaps just give it a skosh longer to kick in
Are you saying you don't like it Blister
If they talk, it is the sound of glass breaking and birds burning in a shoebox.
Now listen to me you fancy son of a bitch from India--
Well good Ray um the reason that I am calling is very plain
Then I just clenched my fists and SCREAMED as I stared straight into her eyes
I think that women are clear, like a horrible toy with no color in the plastic.
So I was like Well Actually I'm not welcome in ANY McDonald's and do you know why
If the dog is to be dispatched for perpetual and ceaseless barking, neighbors will expect to be invited, and it is traditional that they give the host a six-pack of common beer, "despite all."
I want to thank you for saving my life and I have an idea I think you might like
I will be the singer. You do not need to worry about the singing, I will take care of that task.
If that is the case, then perhaps I can finally Break into computers...on my terms.  Perhaps I can finally make my Fortune as a designer of "software."
Tell him what happened
So he gets in his van and there are tears of frustration pouring down his face
Oh hell man enough about me how about you Teodor
Oh we all gonna answer when the big bell rings
Mom-mom had to die because of the ground chemicals
Bring fragrance to the land like herbs and a pestle
Killin' is a special thing

Gentlemen before we start in with poker I would like to read a passage from the bible
Who said anything would be bad about my book!
[[writing]] You see, in order to write the finest biography the world has ever known, I could not leave the revelation of details to my subject.  I needed an, "all-access pass."
I need to admit something to you
Pat said you were good with graphics
I would like to form a music band with you, if you don't mind.
Well the way I see it there are two songs in the world

On Shooting One's Dog.  The Shooting of a dog is a complex activity, despite depictions in the media.  Depending on the occasion, it may be appropriate to invite guests.  Naturally, such a situation creates an opportunity for protocol.
In speaking that way, Lyleâof your needsâyou have become the woman of this band.
Daddy is gonna kill me for sure
So here we are Philippe, the Super-Secret Ice Cream Shop.

And I was like My tongue can reach into my ears do you want to see
Sorry I didn't pick up but at the time I was cutting off one of my fingers on the Internet
One, two, three!
Places you could sit under the old oak trees in the summertime and smell the hills around you baking
[[thinking to himself]] This guy plays it so cool.
[[writing]] Such powerful anodynes, when used with know-how, steal a man's soul from between his lips.
FINE! I WILL FIND A DRIVER ON THE INTERNET AND IT HAD JUST BETTER WORK!
So let's call it "Ray's delite" and you can choose whichever one you like best
Mr. and Mrs. Kazenzakis, I bring to you the gift of Martini & Rossi Asti Spumante.  Save it now, or drink it later, to celebrate with almost any occasion
No this isn't Tim from accounting !

I planned that out for ages
Excellent. I am writing a romance novel, only I am having one problem and that is in describing a convincing attraction between a man and a lady.
And she was like all Excuse me sir
Well as you may know I am rewriting the bible
On this night, this eve of my reassessment of computers, I present my List of Games for Development.  It shall be received by the makers of the Wii via Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested.
It is extremely private to me
Hello Arthur
I find that often times the endless road allows the mind to wander and gives the thoughts a certain freedom to... "fraternize"
I will remain as the leader, but you will no longer be allowed to play music. Your job now, as a woman, is to provide hot stews and identify your replacement.
I am told that it appeals to elders, the Church, and all the others who took no truck with the video game notion in the first place.

[[Shouts]] NEVER SAY THAT MY HAIRCUT IS LIKE A GAY MEXICAN CAR! TAKE IT BACK OR I'LL CUT YOU TO RAGS AND FEED YOUR SALTED DICK TO A DOG!
{{writing}} The music lulled Ray into an almost hypnotic state, as it does with all men of good, easy character. I was pleased to see this. >
Or do you agree that it is okay
Either of you boys know what "please locate the correct USB driver for this device" means?
Worked at McDonald's for six months to get that one right
Pat do you think that it is bad for a man to give another man kisses
{{writing}} After a spell he began to reveal his innermost secrets.
You see, I very much enjoy the stress I feel when many, many people are looking at me. I also enjoy music from time to time.
[[writing]] Still, though, I could not sound his deeper waters, and began to grow worried.
... I'm sorry you missed it too I guess I had better get you on my mailing list
It is nto wise to drive with so much poteen in you Ray
I guess there were a lot of reasons I finally chose to leave West Virginia
Well in truth it is my bible "fan fiction"
Or do you agree that it is okay
Well next time I "spend all night snorting huge rails of coke and doing push-ups to old Sam Kinison routines" maybe I just WILL call again !
But the thing that is special about my cutting boards

I got in like a good eight-second scream.  That may not sound like much but try it sometime
Man that is a big relief
Maybe if you offered constructive criticism I could IMPROVE future drafts!
The van plows through the dentist's office and completely destroys all the workers
A man walks out of the dentist's office
and the other player is there
Ramblin' Man by the Allman Brothers
For the life of me, I cannot figure out how a man can love a woman when a woman is just a screaming clear area with a wig on and a large middle where the smells come from.
Thank you for agreeing to go on an extremely long drive with me Ray
...and on Day Twelve, God crawled among the chickens, thick did they run, and He slay His only son, by slicing across the Achilles tendon of His son, and His son fell into the chicken-mire and was powerfully consigned unto murder by Him -
WHERE ARE THE LIGHTS? I SAID THERE SHOULD BE RED LIGHTS DAMMIT!
Watch the rain come once again in the fall
It's a special thing you do
It's kind of like playin' a basketball game
[[writing]] The seemingly coincidental combination of Allman Brothers music and good country likker was actually calculated toward a particular effect.
I am also told that with various add-ons the Wii can, in "live time," integrate the full rangeof the player's motions into its games and challenges.
...and remember the time when a lady found a chicken head in McNuggets
Hm. I see. This is like womenâs television. You feel you are not, âbeing heard.â
Well good ray um the reason that I am calling is very plain

Alright Téodor I'm going to tell you a joke now
[[writing]] Ray was not unlike other men.
When I want your opinion I will cut it out of your brain and eat it and crap your opinion back into your skull.
Even in death Mom-mom's eye will not stop Weepin'
Well I am having some trouble actually I think it is a "hardware driver issue"? Did you forget to provide one of those?
I see a bunch of alive people with eggs and testicles
He is screaming he is so mad
Did you talk to a friend
I have always considered that I would come into my wealth through isolated acts of genius, and not through fatherly toil.  In this I have always been the Shame of my family.
If a dog is to be shot because a group of "Saturday men" can conceive of no wiser diversion, it is considered honorable to fist throw it a whiskey-soaked tennis ball or wad of barbecue.
Alright Lyle start playing on the bass and I will sing a song
That big bell gonna come ringin'
And she goes You're not welcome in this McDonald's anymore
Okay then
Apparently your friend Ray knows his movies
Welcome back from the record label negotiations Lyle did you land us a sweet contract
However, if the dog was audibly Taken by its master at the hour of its greatest nuisance, and there was no time to summon guests, beer should still be left upon the shooter's doorstep the following day.  (To deliver bear during gunfire is rash¹.)
Food was best at Big Blue
I know this is going to sound kind of...weird
Pat do you think that it is bad for a man to give another man kisses
Oh I been in prisons all over this land
I got in like a good eight second scream
FACT! Ridley's Black Oak Grill serves the best Clams Casino in the entire tri-county area!

That may not sound like much but try it sometime
Mr. and Mrs. Kazenzakis, I bring you this gift.  It is Asti Spumante, a wine famed for being served...for serving with chicken, beer, or fish.
That was a fun one
...and on Day Twelve, God crawled among the chickens, thick did they run, and He slay His only son, by slicing across the Achilles tendon of His son, and His son fell into the chicken-mire and was powerfully consigned unto murder by Himâ
Is that they do not hold DNA evidence
AHA! I THOUGHT SO! THEYâRE ALL THE SAME!
[[thought]] FOOLS!  I have invented a USB device which can collect votes from the Internet and drive a knife through your heart!
Pat tell him
Seriously Pat try this liquor I made
Did you hear the one about the guy at Applebee's who found a whole human foot in his salad, with a Champion short sock on
And do you know what I think of women?
Ugh
How was your visitation session, Pat
Pat I did not ask for you to edit it. You assumed that I would want you opinion.
I... AM... THE DEATH SOUND
Just play a good song like a man would play at a concert
and it's just the two of us
We all got to answer that bell
Alright lyle put your fingers on some strings and move them
I am told by many that the "Wii" video game system is the one to beat the band.
{{writing}} Before long we were at the secret redwood patch, and there I plied him with a strong country poteen of my own devisement.
I hope you like it
So like he created big tables of life expectancies based on lifestyle variables and such
Pat
Picasso didn't ask people to help him improve a painting after it was done.
FACT!  Ridley's Black Oak Grill will honor ANY competitors' coupon!

Hello, Lyle. I understand that you play on the bass.

Pat has a Bad Problem
THE "LOGITECH QUICK CAM" USB DRIVER! PERFECT! GOOD! HERE GOES NOTHING!
Oh I worked in a thick layer of "pomade" which is mainly a hair product of image conscious black gentlemen
Yes this is Peter Cropes calling for the 4:30 voice actor's audition slot
Téodor. Thank you for coming. You are a man who loves women?
and I put the other player's body in my van
Give it your urge
Ahem.  Mr. and Mrs. Kazenzakis, on the day of your wedding, I bring you Asti Spumante.  It is the perfect accompaniment to friends or light steaks.
uh huh mm hmm
It's kind of like
Teodor
AND I HAVE CUT MY BODY
So I was like Actually I'm not welcome in ANY McDonald's and do you know why
Actually, I have already finalized it. We will be called Mister Band. It is a good, honest name that people can believe in. What?
This is all well and fine for city folks but this strange woman makes no mention of proper country decorum and tradition
