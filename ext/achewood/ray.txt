'Sall the same to me, homeness.
It's Lyle's! It's a little snub just like Tony Soprano has!
Okay.  Lord of the Rings was huge.  Nobody needs to say that.  Way I see it, you guys help to meet the demand people got for elf-battle stuff in the wake of those films.
[[reading aloud]] "Your mom? You mean that sweet little subroutine I had in my lap last night?""
Exactly, dogg.  It is real straightforward stuff.  I ain't into those therapies where they have you memorize random numbers and shit.

So, like, what's it you do here?
Ain't those the same people gave us lynch mobs, asbestos, and flour-gut?
My tuna tartare came out all ill. I can't tell what the problem is.
So put it in their room!
Man, that's crazy talk! A leg stump ain't got holes where your urine can go, Ron!
Lyle's so pissed at me that he shot my new Escalade!
ROAST BEEF!  I think I broke the program!  Oooooh damn!  Oh no!  Ohhhno-no-no-no-no!

Hey Roast Beef! Who do you think does the best somersault, you or m---
zzzzzz
You hear me? I'M GONNA GO HIT THE CAN!
See, Beef, you got just DUMB scratch for the first time in your life.  You ain't know how to handle it, but there's plenty of sniffin' dogs that do.
"Josh Rents a Wimp."
That car is the car that Trent Reznor drove in high school! If you get in, you are certain to experience total despair!
Dang! How are all those people gonna answer for all those tattoos? You know there's bound to be some regrets!
Tell me! When you telemarket, do you feel a sense of Shame?
What the hell, man? You been watchin' too many women's television programs! Get lost!

Now you got me yellin' in front of my little baby dirt!
Hey Roast Beef! I'm callin' Marmaduke! Check this out!
Uh huh. Excellent. This is really clicking. Keep going.
Well, I'll get it in the mail first thing! Thanks for the sale, mom!
Thanks, hometicket.  Put it anywhere, I'll find it.
Grrr! Roas' beef! Mmmmm!
Precisely. Think of all the big secrets that are hidden out in the open like that!
I just found out Little Nephew's been sellin' me bogus Dennis Quaid memorabilia on eBay. I hate this feeling.
Oh man, it's a Magreaux dog!  Quick, let's cross the street like we didn't see him.
Now, you have to understand, getting one's Bone on is a big responsibility!
I hate knowin' this stuff exists.
The hell, Beef! You saw what he was gonna do to us!
Whoo! Now THAT is a BOAT, Teodor!
Pat!  What in hell you want, man!  I'm busy!
Big deal.  Take a hike.
You know what the problem is with taco stands? Trust.

Envelópe! It's Ray, across the street!
Wow. Yeah.
[[thinking]]Daaamn...a BOAT!
So what?! You gonna blow somebody away? Not with MY gun!
Pat, I apologize to you. From, Ray Smuckles.
Damn. Sounds like I got to be an army leader. Are there side dishes?
What do you clowns want?  You lost or something?
Alright, guys!  How's that compositin' goin'? You able to make some pretty hot scenes outta all that Rod footage?
I like their product! I wanted 'em to have a little walkin' around money!
Very good. Well, you may dismiss your guard. I'll be home shortly.
Damn, they did that in your family too? My great aunt used to mix that up for my Uncle Gerard!
Better that three men lead ordinary lives than the world come to an end.
Naw, man! They read that fake Yahoo personals ad and thought that was my thing!
He don't dig on jokes about his family. I guess I forgot that.
Huh?!
CAN YOU AFFORD TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR NIKES, DIABETES? CAN YOU?!
I know, man. You want one?
I have Airwolf.  This is not code language.  I am flying Airwolf becuase I own Airwolf.
Oh no!  What is old Cornelius doin' way out this far from home?  Did he finally get senility?
Oh... man. Not your childhood drum.
DAAAAAAMN!
I just ate a hunk of salami, and it is doin' me NO favors.
This is #73, by the way.

"So that no one knows who is who during the competition, it's essential that we both wear identical elephant costumes."
Hey Beef!  You ever taste sugar cookies?  I justâ
Huh? Oh! No, mom! I was coughin'! I ate a really hot chili pepper just now!
I tell you, man. A baby cat comes out, it's like,
Yeah? Yeah? You ever see him fight?
I should get Roast Beef a present! Lessee here...
Admit it day could do more for this counter than any amount of playin' tricks with money.
(Thinking) Let's take Mrs. Williams-Sonoma on the forbidden journey she REALLY wants. Now even husbands gonna read this catalog. Ain't no talent like the one you got, Ray Smuckles.
Hey BEEF! You landed on your NUTS again!
Ideas? Awesome. Comedy is nine-tenths ideas. Hand 'em over.
But check it out, Beef! Red limo!
What the...?
I left a handle in the icebox for you.
Ten women approach me and whisper, "bongiorno,"
Huh? Oh! Right! The porno!
Sheesh... lessee...  There was that 85-story Bloomingdale's in my backyard... THAT never got built... The year before that I said Martha Stewart would come over and sing and cook us dinner...  I even got GROCERIES for that one... jeeez...
Dang! Dad was a real bad-ass!
The main guy, then! Donnie Drabble! I don't know! Just put him on, you ten inch monkey!
I'm not so sure you're the kind of--Beef! Wait!
I was just wondering why you hadn't come in yet today! Can I expect you in a little bit?
It's....it's like I'm channeling Einstein! I'm....I'm writing the diagram that's gonna save the world!
ZZZZZZ
Cool, Todd. Let's go someplace we can chat.
Google, someone who was nineteen designed your logo. It is now seen by every living thing, every day.  Hundreds of years from now, archaeologists will think we were all nimrods.  Nice going.
Uh, no, I guess we don't say it enough.
Hey BEEF!  Check it out!  I'm NAKED!
Hey BEEF! Check it out! I'm NAKED!
Here, let's get a Post-it and a calligraphy pen.  This is way too cute not to mock up.
Pat, man, it's Ray!  Where the hell are you?  Pick up!
Beef, why do I get a feelin' that our army's made up of ex-kids who were always picked last for kickball?
Alright, there it is. Found it.
You got a gift, man!  You can make any dude at all understand science!
No they ain't gonna know just by lookin' in your eyes!  Act normal, and get on the damn plane!  We filmin' our first episode tonight, Todd!
Ooh, okay. Here, let's talk over here.
He made nachos later.  He called them "Galaxy Nachos"?  Is that a certain recipe?  They were so tasty that I wished I had made them instead of him.  I really need to get in control of this.
Hey, man, don't knock my I-Quizzie.
Huh? Oh, come on, now. You ain't even got to demur.
Man, this ain't workin'. I was born horny, loved Playboy since I was three, and need more than I'm gettin'. I got to call a sex line and make today happen.
DAAAAAMN, PEOPLE
Okay, Todd. I did a little protoyping after we chatted last night, and I branched out our Ana-Tomix concept a bit.
Whoops.
If it wasn't for you, rats would probably be eatin' my head in a dumpster somewhere!
I'm rollin' large, makin' numbers at craps!
I'LL GIVE YOU FIFTY BUCKS!  BE REAL WITH ME, BABY!
Oh...like when I should be allowed to wear socks in the bed and when I shouldn't.
what's up miggroid! $$$
HEY, LOUSY HOMEMADE DIRT! PAT IS ON THE PHONE!
Still though, dude, I did a lotta work gettin' a computer installed that could talk like KITT. Come see.
Emeril food! Now! Why come ain't nobody stuffin' a lasagna inside a turkey! Where's the butter? Put butter on what I said!
Yeah, man. Dilbert.  Probably gonna get sued for even sayin' that name.
Philippe!  You wanna see a neat trick?
You tried to watch a movie in my home theater and ended up setting off the alarm?
Let's go see America!
Other homeless people, you're Fired! Heh heh!
I'm LEAVING! I HATE you!
Heh! Man, what a scene!
Huh. ...Huh. Wow. Man, that makes a whole lotta sense. Like when Oprah has them all screamin' and waggin' their arms around about God knows what- not a jasper in sight.
Aight, Connie. Let's get those cougars creamin' for a... lemme see here... "Traditional Sicilian Caper Desalinizing Bowl."
So what's his whole thing?
Jeez, man. Alright. Yeah. Yeah, I'll take it. Shit, dude.
A lot of people are calling bullshit on that tostada, dude.
Whoah.  I don't know who Steve is, but I don't think I'm invited to his Party.
I... hold on. Got another call. Must be that Craigslist woman with the cherried out 12-dog Aztek, got the French drain in the floor.
Come on, baby! Let's French!
Roast Beef!  Why'd you miss dinner?  Where's Showbiz?  What's up with all this Blue Nun?
Whoah, was that a little noise?!
Eh, it was nothin'.
A
Abalone! Sassafrass! Mortise! Phones! Stand down, son---I'm on a roll!
Téodor!
A bunch of limeys who want to be sad girls ain't gonna cut it.
WHAT?! Who the hell was it! Is he okay? Talk to me, you two! Now!
Look, Beef! I'm hitting myself! I'm hitting myself! Look!
Hoo-oooo!
IBM's logo speaks of hard-ass instant coffee and Barney Miller.  We think of the smell of carbon copy forms. It is assumed that men will drink rye at lunch.
Man, you dumbass squirrels ain't nothin' but trouble!
come over doggie
You even see the delivery?
Maybe he doesn't even sell weed at all, and just uses that as a cover for takin' pictures of me on the can!
Okay, okay. I'm listening.
Don't you start encouragin' him, Beef!
What? Oh, I'm startin' a comic strip. You ever heard of Google Image Searches?
Oh no!  What's old Cornelius doin' way out this far from home?  Did he finally get senility?
Cool.  Thanks, man.  You got it around your neck now?
Huh? What, Deanster?
Sorry, mom. So, like I was sayin'---
{{in real life, to himself}} I HANDLED this!
What the fuck, man?!
Oh, hey Doc Andretti! How's Cornelius doin'?
Let's see here...you bought four licenses, one for everybody in your residence... very nice of you by the way...
"Sir, I have an honorable idea."
Damn, man! Todd totally doesn't care that he's fat! Rock on, Todd!
Yeah I've heard of "Weezer." Of course I have, God dammit!
Here, man!  Have some brew!
It... It's not your fault.
TÃ©odor I-- Do NOT drag my merkin in the breakfast eggs! You gonna RUIN that merkin!
... Key Lime Hollandaise ...
Nightlife Mingus! Roll on, baby!
Oh HELL yes!
Dude, you read this story about the komodo dragon got pregnant without any dudes around?
Seriously, dude, I got a pretty slammin' coffee machine last month. I can do stuff with whipped cream or foam, man, you name it. Caramel lattice? Hold down shift and hit #7, man.
Man, somebody cut this guy off. He's saddin' so hard a poem came outta' his face.
Oh, you know. Everything the kicked and krunked new family needs! 5" spinner rims for the stroller, 45-degree leaning carseat, Wu Tang mobile with detachable Ol' Dirty Bastard...
AAAIIIIIGHT!?
Sounds like him. He's old as hell, and he's been leavin' the toilet seat at like a forty-five degree angle lately.
Oh, get over your fussy self! Step on out.
Oh! Right--
Have more Chablis.
Roast Beef! Help! The computer went all in black and white! HELP!
Don't snoop around! Just download the damn program!
They go out into the woods and they find a really poor beetle who's tryin' to get a used car for his daughter to take to college. The guy has ruined credit, and zero savings, and right in front of his daughter the salesman throws him out by his collar. Literally. He drops his hat and the salesman kicks it to him. He has to bend over to pick it up.
You know, I been meanin' to diversify my portfolio lately.  I like to play the restaurant industry ... you want to talk?
Pat! 'Sup, legally gay person?
This ain't a hat of computer people! Dan Rather cold sports this sick piece on a chilly day!
They just neutered Carl, Beef! I just heard!
Right.  Then there are these guys who do monthly inspections on it to make sure it ain't bein' stored in direct sunlight, hasn't come back to live, etc.  This is all explicity stupulated in Keith's will.  I kinda wish I'd known this stuff first, but what are you gonna do.
I can't take this anymore, man. These dudes have got to stop it. This has just gone on TOO LONG.
You ain't gonna get no ladies with all that high-end mumbo-jumbo!  Take it down a few!
Hey man, this is weird! Look how Domino's cut the pizza this time!
His computer's in the car.  Let's check it for a note.
That Kurt Cobain...I ain't a main person of his thing. but he wrote some good songs. I'll say that.
Alright dogg, I'm takin' on The Game.
Stand down, Roast Beef! Water has hella nutrients in it!
Yet you can't buy fake nuts for your phone no matter how hard you try.
You're thinkin' too far ahead, Beef.  Just do it, and if you don't dig it, you can stay in my pool house 'til it all blows over.
Waterbury, um, are you a secret agent instead of a butler?
It's okay, Beef! Right! Everything is cool, man!
Hey, man, don't knock my I-Quizzie. 183 is serious times, dogg.
Daaamn, T! Whatchu lookin' at there?
Oh, and we ain't listenin' to The Cure on the way, either.  I need to be pumped.
Oh, alright . . .
You totally want to kiss her! You want to kiss her on her TITTIES!
TÃ©odor, we hoped you would shine during the cooking event, but you folded with a focus and intensity normally seen only in successes.
Hey, Pat! How you feelin', doggie?
Oh! Dude! That stings! Ow, stop sayin' that you take you take a shower!
It always caused me to make doodie come out of me, onto the ground!
Playboy is actually pretty tame, I think that even grandparents--
Wait right here! I'm gonna bring up the hibachi and call the fellows!
STUFF IS ON THE GROUND IN MY YARD! HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, SUCKER!
So what's the story, Lie Bot?
Never mind cologne! have you got a jimmy hat?
The Taco Bell frequency! You know, the one they use for their drive-through headsets?
Whew! did we nail that one?! Did we? Don't sweet-talk me, now!
Heyo!  Money shot!
What the hell!
Share this moment with me.
Uh, hello?
Well I'll be! Says here that George Clooney is learnin' Coptic!
I hate making calls like this.
Tough shit! Open it!
They oughta take a picture of me and put it on money!
Listen...could you help a brother out and tell me where exactly I am in terms of space and time?
Ouch. You do that hotel room-service impostor thing we agreed about? Upgrade package B?
Hug the fuck out of 'em Philippe!
Damn, Pat!  Pick up!
Oh my Lord! Did the AIBO lung not work?
So let me get this straight:
"Try using unlburicated condoms as condiment dispensers at your next backyard barbecue!"
Hey you two! Where's Beef? I got to discuss somethin' with him!
No, I - no, man!  No!  Jesus, Lyle!
The HELL I just walked home from Mexico! Somebody cook me some damn Emeril food!
Sizz-Ell Readyness 'n' Khryme Kube is the best thing anybody will ever hear in their LIFE, so SIT ON IT AND SCISSOR KICK, WOMAN!
I think I got some Tuaca!
Teodor. Welcome. Very lucky for you that you showed up just now.  Congratulations, in a way.
Oh, listen man, do me a quick favor and erase all history of crimes I have committed recently.
Now let's do a dry run off the teleprompter. Jaime the Science Friend, take one! Three... two...
Ain't you get it, man?  He ain't gonna stop at that!
[[off]] Oh yeah. Act like you ate the candy, Rod. But also act like you deserved it.
KISS MY ASS, BITCH!  I'LL BE AT DUANE'S!
We've made a discovery. A breakthrough. Please, remove your pants.
With ballet so expensive these days, I can't afford NOT to wear them!
"What do you want?" asked Joe, stiffly.
I'm sorry Philippe. I couldn't catch him. Let's just go back and open your present.
So, things didn't go too good with James Brown, huh?
Yeah, I'm lookin' for some assistance. A gentleman's gentleman, if you will.
Damn straight it is. I got a weakness for the stuff. You take an olive or a twist?
... or ... or Slow-Roasted Ancho-Raisin Chutney ...
Right now you just springin' this stuff of people willy-nilly.  How you gonna build a brand like that?
Oh, shut up, Beef. What do you know.
Serious? How come?
Alright, O'Malley. What else did you dig up on Bensington Butters.
What's IN it, dude?
Straight-up drink a glass of milk!
Hey TÃ©odor!  It's Ray!  How you doin'?
Yes, I take sit-down baths! How about you, my goth brother? Do you sit down in a sit-down bath as well?
Ray Smuckles, baby! I just got a quick question for him about how he chooses a butler.
...I don't care how late it is, I WILL come pick you up if you call me, no questions asked...
(A) Chivas, and (B) wearin' too tight of gray trousers from Sears.
(thinking) Try a different sex position each day...
(thinking) Man, I am at a crossroads here.
Teodor! Just the man I been wantin' to see!
Well, Téodor, I don't know if I like it until the focus group tells me, now do I?
I tried lookin' on-line, I called a matchmakin' service, I had a voodoo guy rub a Ken and Barbie togetherâ¦ nothin'.
Hey folks!  It's...
Sssip
Also, I called him a piece of shit and told him to fire us.
No, I mean you might be from like Trembly-on-Kent, but you say London because you think that's the only place in England I've heard of!
Cool! And not even a down payment!
Whoah! Hey, Beef! Don't be drivin' that thing! You're completely HIGH AS HELL!
I believe that would be you.
What it is, Lyle! You into some Tequila? I also got some tasty sangria that Pat brought over!
I would like to get this done.
But what about the dude who wants his phone to have three balls?
Pat... is... fine!
I hope to crap they're OK!
Well, when they do somethin' besides have Rick Moranis piss tons of beer out of his dick, then maybe Strange Brew won't be the only thing about Canada.
Exactly.  I'm talkin' housewife in gym clothes at Starbucks goin', "Which of you lanky baristas wants to steal me husband's stupid Corvette and move to Cancun?"
Kind of weird. It's like, the color of everything there is just slightly notgood enough.
But, to this day, we miss them! No wonder society is so screwed up!   *We're all standing around wondering where our real dongs are!*
Dang, Beef. You are a total scholar of the Fight. You... wanna be my roadie?
Kelly! Give this guy Jagers until he can't say Molecule!
Dang, man! Fatherhood, huh? You even see the delivery?
Doc! Doc Andretti! It's Ray, man!
You... we even got a drink? Ass men don't got no drink!
Dang!  I feel like a million bucks!
Alright, I got just the thing. Check this, Beef.
Whoah!  What in the HELL?!
I'M SORRY DOCTOR KISSES
You know the clerk thinks you're an idiot for gettin' movies with titles this stupid, porn or not, man.
Daaamn, there's no Wikipedia entry for "Ray's urine"! >
Well, like, you know Beef.  He gonna feel like an egg in a bag in Monaco or Antibes.
Heh heh! How'd you know I was out of olives? You crack me up, TÃ©odor.
You catch anything else? Any details about him? What about his car?
Okay, maybe you can only admit happy things on Admit It day.
YYYYEAH!
I'm gonna clear my head and wait for the lyrics to come.
Hey hot mama! Can you dig it?
Actually, that's a great example. Look: I wasn't there bein' all historical, so I'm like, "Bastille Day? There's poop in the river and the peasants are dyin'? Whaaat?"*
The song is coded into the road!
Yes well but this is just a bit silly now! I can't even see the dang nachos!
Alright, Rod. We couldn't find anyone else to star with you, so you just get on the bed and do what you gotta do to make this dirty.
Oh Pat, for shame! For shame, Pat!
Uh, his campaign ain't too solidified yet.  What ticket do we want him runnin' on?
Look dude, if you can't have fun playin' with a toy truck, then it's time to reevaluate your life. You've become jaded.
My "trolley"?
Tite, man. My place, tonight, you and Molly and Connie and that chick and me.
{{thinking}} Foul mood?
E-mail or text me that question. I ain't on IM lately, some Finnish guy thinks I'm his cousin. Next?
Man, but does it suck to run a mile!  Back me up, Beef!
Envelópe! Que pasa, señor hombre!
I mean, don't get me wrong.  I'm not against gays.
No, you thinkin' of Fratella San Zanille.  Candy is still alive.  Check it out.
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT IF I SO MUCH AS BLINK I MIGHT GO INTO STAGE ONE RENAL FAILURE
hey, check this out! They discovered that Boy George is the best singer in the world! Now that's some news you can use!
Listen, it's only about ten blocks back to my place. We should play a game while we walk!
DÃ¢vidÃ©.  Like, 'DAH-vi-day'.
Damn, man. Can you stop this? It's, like, startin' to make me had bad impressions of you.
You know, I used to know a guy who AIDS once.
Go on! Get in!
We been over this, Beef! You a handsome fellow! You just a few hearts shy of confident, that's all!
We just closed the Todd Account! We drinkin' us some kinky Aberlour!
I brough a little hat for it. It's in my overnight bag there on the -
Uh, Beef?  Did y-you use cash or credit card for this place?
(thinks) Someone finally shot that Morrissey character
Alright Beef, this is just between you and me, dig?
Drunk test! Ray Smuckles, professor of Doctorology, pres - man, whatchu doin?!
So what do you think, Beef? Is it a pretty good contract?
It's the Nazi skinhead band you were in! In high school! Sausage-leg jeans, kicky-boots, the whole deal!
Little Nephew What in HELL are you wearin'?!
Nah, man. If you went down on me, I'd probably just talk the whole time to keep it from gettin' awkward.
Roast Beef!  Why are you bringing me breakfast in bed?
I mean, he's got a nervous stomach from way back, but I ain't never seen anybody get all ill from just weed!
You get my smokes, little guy?
Teodor!
Hey Garfield!
So, did you get to spend much time with dad growing up?
Hell yes I can prove it. You name the place. I call you or your local representative out.
What?
I was gonna use a recipe from it tomorow!
That's why you and me gotta reinvent gay porn, dude.  We gonna design stealth DVD cases that only gay dudes know to pick up, cases that are virtually impossible for anyone else to care about.
Hey. Yeah. This is Ray Smuckles over at Prime Time.
We just closed the Todd Account! We drinkin' us some kinky Arberlour!
That game we used to play in the fifth grade?! Man, that game was decent! Say, you think they still makin' it?
God dammit Todd.
I don't know, Pat. Maybe I'm progressive, but maybe also you're old-fashioned, like all knowin' what it looks like for a horse to go to the bathroom start-to-finish. I ain't sure, but I'm almost sure, and the man who invented the future barely even had that.
Come on, Cornelius!  Get Primal and let's go pick up some ass at The Smoke!  How long's it been since you rattled that old saber?
[[obviously concerned and wringing his paws as Dr. Andretti clutches his clipboard]] Don't tell me he's dead Dr. Andretti! Say it ain't so!
Come on, Beef!  I'm goin' nuts just listenin' to this AM radio!  Let's get some new tunes in the car!
Now I ain't watchin' the news! News ain't on at three damn o'clock!
Some old guy was sellin' it, sayin' it was a time machine.
You may gripe about my Caddy, but we losin' the Ice caps 'cause of you needin' to have Emotions Hair in high school.
I'm fine with jokes about Italians eatin' plastic fruit in a lobby, or Irish guys named Paddy who can't figure out how to walk down stairs, but I am just NOT down with Polack jokes.
Get outta here! You can't come in here when I got important stuff goin' on! You gonna screw me up!
What the heck is that, Beef?
Yeah, Ozuma Sushi? Listen, we need two Beef Teriyaki dinners at 11 Via Verde! The money is under a rock in the front yard and you will be fighting the Kama Sushi deliveryman for it.
It's like, every goddamn product go to have some kind of deal or promotion! Why can't a product just sit on the damn shelf and be quiet?
Now why would you say a thing like that to Jack White
Oh, it is.  But I got all drunk once and promised her that she had another one on September 26th, "as far as I was concerned."
Look, I gotta go be a spineless hero to sixty million water cooler wimps who have their password written on the back of their hand. Later on, horse dogg maniac.

Make love like a mountain!
THE MAN IS SO OLD SCHOOL HE DRIVES A YELLOW BUS WITH GOTHIC ARCH WINDOWS!
Now I gently push you back against the pillows.  I pull you close and breathe you in.  Your scent is delicious.
Ah, old Colonel Ephraim.

Good! Now...you know how to put the jimmy onto your wee-wee, right?
You finally doin' it, man! You finally doin' it!
Hey Lazarus, look! I just ate about half this piece of paper!
Dad! It's me, Ray! From... from Sondra, you know!
The M.E. said Leo had such a massive heart attack that the heart actually broke off and went almost an inch to the left, tryin' to escape the attack. It's called Scared Heart Syndrome, apparently. Anyhow.
Nothing else I could say would make more sense given what I own and what I am doing at this moment.
Nonsense! That's crazy talk. Get on in and let's go back to the party. You can urinate at my place.
Children are pretty good, you know.
Still, man! How am I ever gonna find him again?
For mailing!  So you ain't gotta judge and guesstimate!
You like Ketel One, right?
Used actors gripin' in a hot tub ain't exactly the four horsemen of the apocalypse, dude.
(thinking) On the other hand, Japan Man is wrong.  If you can't hang in the major leagues, you simply shouldn't play.
THis guy Ed Gredby just got killed in a truck fire! They said he couldn't get out, so his friend shot him in the head before he could burn to death!
-no, actually the pro down at the club recommends this one brand for your grip-
Heh! Yeah.
Yeah, dude!  Ask me to draw somethin'!
If you think about it, it just makes a ton of sense.
Oh Paaa-aaat!  Somebody's gettin' his Booooone on!
Oh ...all right. Hey, did I tell you I got back with Tina?
"A-ha"...ain't that the band that made Chucklebot gay?  GHOST!!!
PLEASE FORGIVE ME
Yo mama so grouchy, she slaps the doorknob before she turns it!
Yeah... I started to go into withdrawl there for a second!  I was sad and scared!
Lyle! What it is, sucka!
Lay it on me!
No, no, can't risk it!  I'll see if we can set up an emergency appointment with Dr. Andretti.
DAD WON THE GREAT OUTDOOR FIGHT?! I should know stuff like this! Mommm!
Man, he was supposed to give me back my damned Wayans Brothers cookbook!
Nolan from the Internet? Ray Smuckles, not of the Internet. Look, here's the funny thing. I don't know you, yet I have hired a variety of men to create  a certain sort of relationship with you. What? Oh. A death relationship.
Seriously, man!
Daaamn! Look at this, Téodor!
I was thinkin' more along the lines of a prime rib. You got maybe a bi-curious 7-bone?
It's your exclusive, "by invitation only" form of Jehovah's Witnesseyism!
I found some old Thompson Twins tapes that we can use to listen to!
Oh, snap! Bensington Butters just signed KC 185-Loot! I was all hyped to land them on Prime Time! DAMN him!
Roast Beef! Philippe wants to see how small you can make your eyes.
Beef, are you in the fight?
Alright, Beef. Your catchphrase is, ¡Sciencia -- Que Bueno!
So long, soldier.
She was all just whinin' and carryin' on for so many days I wanted to get on a plane and cold fly her ass outta there myself!
Whew! Thanks for all the fingernail schnapps Rudy! Or whatever that was!
Somebody says I'm gay, I'll just sit here bein' straight, and they'll be wrong.
That game we used to play in the fifth grade?! Man, that game was _decent_! Say, you think they still makin' it?
Sorry, man, too late! Just read the lines off the teleprompter!
I am ... SO sorry ...
Say now, is that Todd? NO! It is not Todd! It is Carla!
You ever heard of "Asleep Style"?
Dang, you got burned on a dot com, huh? Which one?
Pat! Wait! I have a date tonight! Can I borrow the hat?
Wait... what? Who are you?
Ray! From Prime Time Records!
PAT! Come back here!  We gotta think up... let's see now... 33 new names!
Man, that cat already knew how to use the damn toilet.
That's IT?
Speakin' of which, when you gonna make an honest woman outta Molly?  Don't dodge this one!
yeah! what's up?
TEODOR! WHAT IS THE DEAL?
Maybe I can make one...
Well, we gotta take. Philippe starts school tomorrow!
About twelve and a half minutes later, the lawyer persuades the owner of the building to fire the imperfect bartender.
And for the fish course, the Turbot Ã  la Meuniere.
It's the wild card!  You got to guess what the effect is!  Here, see if you can tell.
Where'd you learn to talk that way, boy?
Maybe I am. But maybe there's somethin' real basic, and kind of fun, that you can do for me.
Hey, you can make fun of me all in your corny deep voice, or you can get in on the ground floor of this thing.
Dude, would you ever get a tattoo, Beef?
Seriously, man!  Who writes this shit?
NO I WASN - Teodor! Where am I?! What's going on?
Garfield, you gotta wrap it up, man. Lasagna, Mondays, people have it all figured out. You are kind of like an idiot who keeps pressing the same button.
It's solid, man. Do you think my Loretta Lynn is decent?
Ahhh, there we go.
Not now, Beef, I'm on the line with Bob Nardelli.  You know, CEO of Home Depot?
Hey, you two! Hop in and I'll give you a lift back to the party!
Yeah... yeah, I think I do.
Think about it, Beef!
Damn, girl! You finally gettin' serious about  doin' visual merchandisin' for The Body Shop? Tell you what, let's meet for a power cosmo down at Napoleon's. Catch up.
You know what you need? Cards for times of dudes. Dude-to-Dude cards ain't even a category yet, and you can own it.
Guys, I have an idea on how to get Roast Beef to come home!
Got the harness on right?  You breathe okay?
You know, I been meanin' to diversify my portfolio lately. I like to play the restaurant industry... you want to talk?
My dad won it back in '73.  You can check it out online.
Oh hell no, man. I hate watchin' unshaved librarians do the limbo under some dude's cane.
I even paid him ten bucks for a mustard packet he said Quaid used on the set of Twister...
[[Imitating Simon Cowell]] "Steve, yew moan loyk a wingeing spinsta'. And Ron, t'tell yew the trewth, I was bored from the moment I saw yew."
Dude, let's smoke! FOREVER! Just like we always said!
Hey, man. You got to get used to this. When guys hang, they talk about sex. You know that.
Hey PAT! Teodor says you broke my new banjo! What the hell, man? Totally uncool!
Whoah, whoah. Hold on. I can still smell it.
Way much people are signin' up for this class.
Damn! These days, bein' gay is, like, one better than havin' an iPod!
you give a beggar your meal, he only loves you while it's on his lips - aint no dude gonna lay down on day three just cause i gave him a drumstick
Yeah, operator?  Get me Home Depot.  High up as you can get go.
Right, totally. You sure I can bust down this wall, right? We only got one take, you know.
It's a '65 Ford Galaxie, just like you always talkin' about!
You need a couple bucks for the road?
Oh well!
Actually, I can't say what the CEO does.  I'm under an NDA.  That's the only way they'd show it to me.
You've got about two seconds, Todd.
Oh DAMN it! It's like six degrees out here! C'mon, stay lit!
I can even have it write in the style of a famous author! Here, I'll print up a few samples for you.
Ahhh. Bliss.  Say, what do you guys feel like doin'?
Yeah, and that was actual real music! You, you  just yellin' to some beatbox, sayin' that algebra is gay!
Huh? Why? Keep it short, man. And no details.
Enough already!  Why don't I call in some Boston Market.
Say, man! Why not set this stuff to a hip-hop beat!
Hey, Téodor! Good to see you, despite the comment!
Oh shit yes!
Like, "yo mama's so fat, she broke her leg and gravy came out!"
Hi, Beef! Ooh! Guess Basket! Guess Basket! I been lookin' forward to this, man!
YOU WANT TO BE NINE-TEEN? GO AHEAD!
Yeah, but not this time. You seein' people like Roger Moore fly around the worldâtwiceâto eat this kind of stuff. 'Course, the cheese is in a perfect triangle on a MÃ¶bius chip at El Bulli, and not all raggedy, like I'm doin' here.
Little Nephew! I made us up some Chicken a la King! New recipe!
Dang, that ain't how you spell "sandwiches"!
Say, you think they still makin' it?
Jesus Christ, Tina!  Shut up and call a doctor!  LOOK AT ME!
Alright, now talk.
That stressed me out, so I tried to light a smoke, only my Zippo ignited the damn air! Flames shot out like oak tree roots, ten feet around!
Pat! Stop! Noooo!
Uhhh... hold on!
Little Nephew, I'm takin' Hyddyn Sceptyre away.
Hey, Philippe! Here's a fiver. Pick me up a pack of lucky strikes.
I did several other photographable things that day, including rinse off grapes and look at a book I have.
You want to go on a little mini vacation to paradise? Come look in my toilet, dude!
Listen, put Captain B on the line.
What's a stitch in time? Is that like black hole theory?
Who's Molly?
Not this time. I finally realized that we just disagree about too many fundamental things.
I have a strong suspicion that his slip into aggression is due to a miscalibrated frontweight. What did you use?
That tacky son of a bitch!  He gonna be alright?
Nice work, O'Malley. You keep your mouth shut about this and maybe the new hip fairy gonna visit your moms next year.
Shit, dude! I didn't get my Fiesta Name!
That just makes me SO mad! SO so mad! Oh my LORD I can't believe how angry I am right now!
{{GASP}}
I don't know, man. You sure this food ain't got armpit hair and a '91 Jetta?
Well how much underwear DID you eat?
Yeah, man! Pat went by to get some old baseball cards and Carl was just ten kinds of lanced!
Oh, no way! You're Bono's butler? Nice to meet you! I mean, I know it's the phone and all, but-
Where'd you pick up this piece of work?!
You know what I mean!
This ain't a hat of computer people! dan Rather cold sports this sick piece on a chilly day!
Thank you, Uncle Culpepper!
No! No! Roast Beef! Uh...uh...hold on! Um...uh...
WHO... ATE... MY... DAAAAAAAANG NAAAAACHOS!
Well, let's just say that the dude was under a lotta stress, and probably not a good guy to begin with.
Care to REPEAT that, little man? I don't think I HEARD you!
Daaamn, my MENSA renewal is here!
Yeah, well. It keeps the toys off my lawn.
[[to himself]] But then again, at the same time, I would feel partially responsible if I let him crawl into heavy traffic or something.
He looked pretty embarrassed.
Qualifyin' rounds be damned. I'm BOC.
This don't make you gay any more than watchin' NASCAR makes you a good driver.
Tina? Dang, man! I ain't even thought about her in like six months!
Whoo boy! Tequila while you watchin' the SPICE channel! And you gotta be...
Shit! Ow! Dammit!
Dude, come on! Close it!
Our experiment's funding has not been renewed. Molly, a voice actress from West Hollywood, has been a valuable asset, and may keep her gemstone. We will debrief Roast Beef out back in the Buick.
Hey Teodor! You get that homemade salsa I FedEx'd you?
Oh, mostly that first one, I guess.
Huh? Man, I ain't want any -
"A-ha"...ain't that the band that made Chucklebot gay?  GHOST!!
Man , Lyle left some bottle of ghetto gut around here.
Okay, Chuck just checked in with wardrobe. Get this on, I got to be scarce.
(Referring to Teodor) This is Wade Hanson.  He's the genius behind your new ad campaign.
Your idea of love is to help a Chinese lady get an MBA so she can dump you?
Daaaamn, Cornelius! Sick flivver!
Like American Idol all mixed with Survivor,
Well, first of all, Weezer could never HAVE a baby with an iMac, so that is a totally dumb way to describe how you think you look!
Huh? You got a list?
Dang but does it smell like simmered-up pinto beans in this place.
Ow!  OWWW!  Damn, that stings!
Heh! Back in my party days, I used to hide MY Sceptyre to these tunes! Know what I'm sayin'?
...So like it ain't bad enough that Little Nephew got himself the Stone Cold F Grade in History this quarter...But now he's fallin' in with that damn Goth crowd!
That game we used to play in the fifth grade?! Man, that game was _decent_!
Nuh-uh, man. I think he just had a little Datsun where the seat folded down.
Oh, this? Heh heh! I got it off eBay.
So where you from, Waterbury?
I wonder if it's havin' any effect on the LA economy, you know, with all those folks outta work...
Hey, let's call that new sandwich place downtown! Neutrino's? Terry says they do a really long Reuben. Like a foot.
(thinking) Perhaps we can wire the machine up to a small taser, which is calibrated to send an exact type of shock to the parietal lobe,
Yes I
I..I really don't know.
("I have never met a man as shiny as you. It is a problem I enjoy.")
Now why don't you just try again! I know you can do better!
I tell you, I ain't nobody's picnic.
But I - yeah, I guess you're right. This is still gonna make a killer Christmas card, though!
You busy?  I can email it to you.  You want that?  Ain't no trouble.
Todd, "Boy Dog" is compelling, but it doesn't cover the market. What about "Girl Dog?"
Who ate my dang nachos?!
Anyhow,  goodnight, diary.  Sorry to ramble.
And when I hear the guitar sound come from the amp it got to be so...nasty...
Remember when we were kids, and we could spend all day just jumpin' our bikes? Totally catchin' some air, biggest thrill in the world...
Y
Man, I hate this logo!
Beef, I hid nine grand under the Fight-Tite Elastoband in my hat. Get us a spread from next door.
You stop snorting all that cocaine IMMEDIATELY!
What?  How?  Why?  What?
That is
I saw a smile! Somebody smiled!
Come on, man.  We known each other since old times.
What's...pimp skitters?
Oh god, look what I just thought. How sick am I.
Philippe is FIVE today! That is SPECIAL!
Let me just remove that.
Dude, shut the hell up! That ain't no fun! A contst got to be fun!
Yeah. He blew all the cash I gave him on smack and then came back to ruin my party.
Holy crud, man! This is ridiculous! I just wanted to make a card for Little Nephew!
Twelve bottles of whiskey, each one guaranteed to make you feel a different way!
[[on phone]] Whoah.  Not cool, Beef.
A dude is gonna play franks and sacks with my favorite kid?! Get me the damn phone, fool!
[reading] Ahem! One: cancel all magazine subscriptions, including AdWeek, Ad Review and Maxim.
A gay turtle with a Prince Albert.
Seriously? You pronounce it "heela-copter"? Everyone I know says "hella-copter."
(thinking) Perhaps I'll just repurpose the joint rolling machine and make money a different way.
Yo! You got a nutty old bear in here? Like, way over three percent crazy? Goin' by the name of Cornelius?
Téodor!
Uh, Jai?
Damn. All this temperature lately got folks real on edge.
You even think for a minute there's some better way to play it?
What's up Drabble, you dipshit?
I'm as serious as all damn hell.  I'll be winnin' the Great Outdoor Fight this year.  (in italiacs) Family tradition.
...so! at $399 per license, it looks like we need to collect about...$1596 from you.
I'll be in my trailer.
Most interesting. Plump, soft white flesh of vanilla and melon yields as a firm hand of chocolate and clove gently pulls the tropical decolletage from her shoulders...it's a forbidden combination, culminating in an explosion of heat and musk.
Check it out, Lyle!  I just got one of those machines that automatically folds a letter into perfect thirds!
I'll set that up if you're serious.
Oh No! I'm going to be late for my job...at the alarm clock company!
Of COURSE I think that people who use Yahoo Personals eat nachos at each meal. Hypocrite?! Hey, that was my BIRTHDAY, asshole!
B? Yeah, it's Ray, man! Ha ha! No, no, I ain't callin' to back outta the tournament! Yeah, I'm still in for my full pledge! Hope you boys don't blow it all on new Pings!
I been gettin' threats from this drug dealer goes by the handle of Japan Man!  We gotta pack it in!
Huh.  You got any other frames I can see?
Alright, fine, whatever! Listen, kid, just look into franchising.
With that coonskin cap on, you look like you're 69ing with the dudes from ABBA!
[[off]] Nice, man. Now gimme something else. Take me back to Broadway, baby.
Swinger? Nah. Transgender? No. A turkey that believed in voodoo? Better not. You got anything else?
I bet her name was Michelle!
Thanks, man. Okay... GO!
[[off]] Ooooooh yeah. Death of a Salesman. Work it. Work it.
Itchy leg syndrome, like amputees get! Missin' something that ain't there!
I'm cookin' us up some salami sandwiches, cooked up real good!
It's your show, man. I'm just tellin' you.
I start doing coke, next thing you know it's a bandana and a needle full of Hi-Five!
All right.  But I ain't got a lotta firepower.
I'll tune 'em out, man. Don't get all Mr. Thinky up in my jam.
We recommend serving this one with buckwheat latkes and modified-death Ottawa venison.
Hmmm...how about we call ourselves "Doggz 2 Tha Bone?"
Daaaamn. Little Nephew has been addin' some chunkity on the waistline lately, and the way things are these days, he is probably a nerd.
What should we do, man? This is the time
Hey! What the hell you doin' in there!  Todd?
It's RAY!
Oh, okay.  Thanks, man.
Oh, no reason. Look, I gotta go check my Outbox.
Vlad.  Always rockin' the sawed-off wisdom.  Dap.
[[surprised]] D...Dad?
Sorry Kev. Oh! Oh! That bubble-butt bartender! Talk about dumb! Hehâhey, don't get me wrong, I looooove dumb, but that was like "stick two wires in her and she can power a clock" dumb. I mean, you ever seen a bartender thinks Heineken is wine?!
Here's the thing. Stephen Hawking couldn't fight his way outta a paper bag, right?
Dang, man! Fatherhood, huh?
Here, man! Take this banjo and practice some while I come up with new lyrics.
And if you want a copy, you got to act pretty much now, because we didn't make that many. Over to you, Philippe!
The hell Africa should have all the hottest e-mail scammers.  That title should be ours, dude.  Come over.
Roast Beef, could you come into my office?
Whoah! How'd you DO that?!
It's been crazy.
Man, what is with these sassy new traffic signs they got poppin' up everywhere?
I gotta think of... for Roast Beef... I gotta... just for once...
You sure aout that, Pat? Looks kinda funny to me.
No, no, no! I ain't interested in no potato chips! I'm INTERESTED in why you would be so careless as to put so many jalapenos on here!
My whole life I always been a little stressed come time to get the letter to fit the right size into an envelope. I blow it about almost a tenth of the time.
Mom took my kit to a company that has a computer-guided cutting tool!  It's EXACTLY like the Ferrari from Weird Science!
Now, for your next challenge, we have nature's ultimate litmus test.
Why don't you start, Pat.
You fellows know where I can get a case of white zinfandel?
...perfectly natural and healthy...
You got it.
Hold on.  What's all this talk I'm hearing about a caboose full of post-menopausal real estate agents?
Huh? What's this?
"A-ha"...ain't that the band that made Chucklebot gay?
Aw, man! I just peed all on the floor around the toilet bowl!
Man, I though you said our chopper was deluxe!  This thing looks like a chicken jumped into R2-D2's teleport beam!
You like The Cure, Pat?
he shall... he'll... he'll smite you... where it counts
I was gonna go put a 7-Up bottle full of bloody mary by him in case he's alive.
Men, you have competed in four events, and the results have been surprising.
...there was something that everyone in straight-laced Bayport liked about Ray.
We oughta get us some disguises!
Plus if blind people click on our link, we now have invisible jokes!
No, not yet.  But we kind of had a little talk.  You could see the dude steel up.  He knew it was time.
Well, my tastes are pretty traditional, but a plain old turkey just ain't that... interesting, you know? Alternative lifestyle turkeys, huh? Talk to me.
Man, what are all you guys doing out here? I just cooked up a delicous chicken!
(thinking) On the one hand, Japan Man is right.  One should be able to make one's own fortune in America.
This country needs a man with a granite sack and legs of log... a man that slaps people who are talking. I am that man.
("My day is a legal crime made factual by my celebration of your surfaces. I chase you in my brain, Friedelmann.")
Hey, Téodor!  Who left you alone with Roast Beef?
Exercise, huh. Yeah, I'll look into it. Thanks.
Hah! Quiz me, Biz!
Oh, shit, the Fuzz!
Daaamn! Player got a little inbox goin' on goin' on!
Yeah, hello? Oh, hey Beef. What's up? I got Cornelius helpin' me out on the other line.
Well, not just by watchin'...I mean, you got to do the deed, of course.
[[Yelling to Beef]] It's just a Lincoln TOOOOOWNCAR!
(typing) Dear Blog: How does the blood
But... but I can't beat real on Beef! He's my oldest friend!
Aw baby, I was just gettin' you primed! You ready to draw those curtains?
Whoah! Blister?!
HEY! Ain't no stewardess gonna hear it digestin' in you, Todd!  LISTEN TO ME!  HEY!
Alright, I'ma let this goofity-assed PT Cruiser back out.  Freshen up my karma a bit.
[[thinking]] Dammit, Hockawock!
Duuuude!  Philippe is fine!  He probably just fell asleep exactly wherever he was standing at 8:30!
Dude, we'll be cut off from communicating during the...wait.
Damn, Beef. I hate to even think of it.
Okay, then! What is the minimum amount you can afford to put toward this financing each month?
It would literally be amazing if I was kidding.
TÃ©odor? What are you talkin' about? This ain't funny, dude.
Sheesh!  This is long!  Mind if I sign it now and read it later?
Okay, Teodor, here's another ten G for you guys' campaign. Let me know when you need more.
Man, I doubt I was CRYIN'!
See now Lyle, I ain't really into the whole leprechaun rock thing.  Strikes me as foolish.  But puttin' out music's in my blood, and part of puttin' out music means believin' in somethin' you don't believe in.
I ain't just buggin' 'cause I like tiny quiche, man.  You know she's got gifts for you for like the next three years hidden in my attic?
Yeah, I'm callin' 'bout the Subaru Baja. That's the ugliest one, right? How many dogs that thing hold?
I didn't call 'cause a player has his pride. This particular player also has a spider bite so big I should probably get it tennis lessons. Excuse me.
Cornelius, you could have won this thing in your sleep, but you didn't, and I'm sure the other players thank you for extending that courtesy.
Hold on -- you already heard it ?!
This test is virtually impossible to cheat! Just go with your gut!
PFUH! Why do I even subscribe!
Man, I just got back from the grocery store. I am goin' crazy.
Silent Bird Wallace, mute as he was, paired up with Aloisius, a stone-deaf and illiterate singer with the most beautiful voice anyone had ever heard.
...so who knew that Tiffany would design you a custom grill if you called them on a whim and discussed the idea and then agreed on a price!
Beef! What it is!
Ooh, cool!  The all-black bottle!
Neat idea.
Baloney!  Show me show me.
Roast Beef! Come on out the spaceship!
Ich habe Gesellschaft!
I'm gettin' that feeling I get about twenty minutes into X-Files.  Come upstairs and watch the window while I try this again.
I AM YOUR FRIEND!
I just ate a hunk of salami, and it is doin' me no favors.
Look, man.
Naw, I ain't want to respond to a survey about time share properties. Fuck you.
'sup, Pops?
Tell me these fluff shows ain't at least better than straight-up public snuff.
...now, you may have noticed that certain parts of your body react differently to heat and ideas...
Alright, look: so the front bench can be lined and made into a cooler....
You must be hungry! What can I get us to eat? Come inside!
Alright, so I'll write a monthly column about men's groomin' tips for our magazine.
Dear Diary: today I yelled at Roast Beef.  I was sorry that I did it --- it's just because he is so good at computers and I am not.  This is not his fault.
Let me guess.  You feel... "bad."  Is that it?  Did I put my finger on it?
A highway with grooves cut into the road perpendicular to travel...
Hmmm... now what should I do with this box?
Wow, man! Neat to meet you!
Alright. Talk to you later, dogg
GO AHEAD! See if I care, you little piece of shit!
--like this!
Good! Bad? Ethanol! Ketel One?
Old Windmill Is tasty! I ain't got to defend that to you!
Alright man, I'm just goin' nuts over here.
What the-- man, erase this! The last thing I need is this windin' up on that damned...
Man, don't be stupid [sips from Bullshit Sunrise cocktail]. Hip-hop is here to stay.
No you didn't.  You existed in an area and nobody did moisture-style touches on your body.  Calm down.
Is it a pretty good club?
I'm ready, doff. I'm callin' Garfield.
Congratulations, Cornelius. You are the baddest dude in town; you are the mirror that shows a normal man that he is a clown.
RUTHERFORD!
Crap, dude!
You need companionship, dude! You been one sad mister since Molly left.
What cows?  What?  What's this about?
Whoah whoah whoah now!  That don't sound so lucky, doc!  In his *spine*?
Teodor, come with me, man.  We gonna storm the roost.
Whoah, man, check this out!  Everything I draw accidentally ends up lookin' like a dick!
An MBA? For reals?
You cold have a peter in your mouth
She ain't gonna call your mom, Beef!  My mom would never call 7-11!
I thought it looked like a fun thing to store wine in.
"Can't talk now, bro.  I'm three-ballin'."
Snoooooze!
Hmmm. So what? I don't follow you, Vlad.
Come on, man. Say good stuff about my dick.
(thinks) I always knew this day would come!
Alright, well, if you really are allergic to chicken we're gonna have to go see the doctor.
Whatchu tryin' to tell me, Paper Trail Jones?
Butters!  You lookin' for your moms?  'Cause I just kicked the bitch out.  I thought you said both her eyes worked!
TÃ©odor!  We startin' an all-stoned slow pitch softball team!  You down, doggie?  Charcoal grill at each base, we can do whatever in hell we want!  This is LIFE!
The most hardcore Chinese make-you-strong "delicacy" ever. And yeah, I'm gonna order it.
Beef, you got the wrong idea about music videos!
Beef, you got the wrong idea about music videos.
It shows that the man is conflicted like everyone else, and in their cars, in private, people admit that they also want to crack wise with some boss lesbians.
Hey! Cool it!
Teodor is like Sam, all cool and smooth...
Doc! Doc! His lips are movin'!
Ha Ha! More like, "You're *welcome!"*
What? Don't lie to me, just tell me if you saw him or not-I'm worried! He has a Condition!
Huh. Yeah. This ain't goin' too good. Maybe we got to talk about things.
O-Okay, dad!
SURPRIIISE! Todd actually WASN'T doing cocaine! Happy Birthday!
Dammit, you're right. I'm gonna go into the garage and smell metal stuff. Instead.
Uh...okay, then! December...25!...1882! Hold on!
Okay, look up and wave.  I need to make sure that's you I'm seeing.
And oh! Who's this?! Why, it's Woody!
You're like chow main, man! You're just not a big deal!
That was a "tainted" shrimp "taco" with "ethnomedical" manioc foam.  It was tasty, dude.  Why you think I had two?
L...Leon?
Yeah, guys! Come on in! I see you already workin' the mojo!
I'm eatin' refried beans for lunch, that's why. How 'bout you?
Hi. Awesome. Great. Thanks for picking up.  Meg Whitman please. CEO of your company. Flat regular lady business hair, probably a Maserati.  Just find her.
Alright, Beef! You take the wheel and head for the gate! I'm gettin' in the back!
Anyways, I've got some hot dogs in the oven. You like to eat hot dogs, right? Baked up real good?
you have to setup a living trust for the thing, you know--to provide for it in case you die--like old people do with their canaries.
Hey hey, everybody! It's Chef Ray's famous citrus-brined chicken!
Nah, don't worry about it.  He's still kind of weird about certain basic aspects of the whole thing.
We recommend serving this one with the flesh of an unborn veal calf, sauteed in hickory butter. No side dishes.
Let's say some cops pull us over...we just make a break for it! Ain't no human can catch a cat!
(emphasis) I had just never tried!
"Get a free DVD of Shrek 2 with this box of cake powder. Half off tickets to Disneyland if you drink this coke. Get a free pound of shredded meat if you mail back this bar of soap."
That's nice, but I feel kind of... like I'm lookin' at a perfectly acceptable car that I sold to a stranger.
Damn, man! Yes! Yes! Old School! OLD School!
What makes you think I can't help you with computer science?
...I could even make it write my name on the screen while the background flashed! If I did somethin' like that today, why... why...
He's old, man! He's about to commit suicide!  Look at him!  It's suicide for sure!
Oh, couple hours.  I'll make him some Spaghetti's Dad tonight.  It's our little ritual - let's him know he's off the hook.
So this whole time you could have like done judo and kicked me on the face?
In fact, you know what? Screw you and all the rest of you self-righteous, "I-get-up-early" types! "Oooh, look at meeeee. I'm so raaaad. I know what the gaaaarbagemen look like."
Beef! Dude! Pastor Shickanell was gonna get picked up in that rape case, but he hooked up this system where when he opened the door for the pizza guy, guns tied to strings shot them both in the head!
...not just five hundred accounts of Todd gettin' high on brick cleaner and cussin' on the couch.
Oh!  Okay, sure!  I'd love to hear your idea!  You know how I am!
They've got such a thing?
Cornelius, listen to me! Why come manhole covers are round? Try to think of an answer, but if not it's ok!
Alright!
[[to himself]] However, last time I saw him we got into a really nasty argument about circumcision. He even went so far as to insult my actual, personal hose.
I'll tell you what. Why don't I double check to make sure I ain't grillin' any rib-eye, and you stand here and test to see if this is a mimosa.
You drove him away with your mean-ness, Pat! {{Curiously, Beef's phone bubble has a zig-zag tail but rounded corners like the standard Achewood speech bubble.}}
Hi! Waterbury? Ray Smuckles!
No. Listen. Who's gonna look slicker in the casket---Johnny Cleanslice, or Timmy Headloaf? You KNOW morticians got to rebuild the head for the viewing.
Ain't you usually fly with Akkolade?
Daamn, I am diggin' these old-school duds!
I'm thinkin' barbed wire band on the upper arm.
Oh, whose ass am I kicking? Yours, or another guy?
Who in hell is Leon Sumbitches and why he sent me an attachment?! Man, this looks like a computer virus straight-up splickety!
I wanted the four of us to have classy dinner parties and boat vacations in France, for our kids to be the same age... hella tite.
Thanks, everyone. You'll find a bowl of T-Mobile gift certificates in the vestibule as you exit.
BEEF! WAIT! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Let's get cameras and stuff and document it!
Wait right here!  I'm gonna bring up the hibachi and call the fellows!
Serious, man!  He says that stuff!
Maybe you could work that part out. I mainly ended up tryin' to see if I could use the computer to get more organized.
A little bit whiskey, a little bit Starbucks!
Damn... you know what America really needs?  "Admit it" day.  Where everybody's honest just for one day.  that's all it would take to turn this gig around.
Dammit! There's the doorbell!
It all seems kind of stupid in the circumstances. I'm really sorry, man.
I guess it's like that old joke, "I don't know if I can play the piano, 'cause I've never tried!"
See!
Yo mama's on the no fly list 'cause she got two hook feet and the croup!
It's my safest course of action.
Chick don't need you figurin' that out for her. She's ten steps ahead of you. Chicks are the chess of deucin'. Courtesy flushese, lipstick lighters, crap gaskets, digital canary--
Phew! Oh, good. Good, man. RELIEF. Jesus.
Hey man, my little nephew really dug that you could come talk dirty at his birthday party.
Aw Chucklebot, if I knew then I wouldn't be in this mess.
So you gettin' cold feet about movin' in with Molly, huh?
Nah. She presses one nostril shut the whole time, then uses the fresh nostril to gauge things at the end. Like a pregnancy test.
Fuck you for thinking of my property as your whore!
Oh, you're right I'm just settin' myself up for failure readin' this same one over and over again
Hey Connie! Got a minute to give me notes on my latest manuscript?
Don't break the seal, dogg! Don't break the... wait, what?
AH...
Bullshit. Canada needs to know about ME. Why in hell I got to mess around memorizing a pretend country?
I bet if you could read your email in their eyes you wouldn't mind the kink!
...if he ever makes it back here, I think we're gonna *start* that rap company.
Right on, man. I gott warn you, thse things are addictive. I think I put away like six or seven just by myself.
In fact, I'm gonna get started right now. Let's go.
My
Might as well find out.
[[Thinking]] What a damn lovely morning it is.
Exactly. You ain't havin' nobody over if there's a damn cumshot.
Ich liebe mein Kultur
Teodor! This is Robert Smith, from The Cure! I am their main singer! How are you, dogg?
That hick.
Yeh, yeah, of course.  I think I got my best ones out on loan though.  Here, let's take a look.
If things don't turn around, I'm gonna get a sex change and a time machine and give myself the kind of science fiction romp that Donald Trump only dares to dream about!
Roast Beef! You should get down here! We lookin' at *hella porno!*
Right. Just make me a card, but like of life. My stats and stuff. I'll pay you a hundo. See you in an hour?
[[thinking] Well would you look at that
Yeah, O'Malley. Photos just showed up. I'm takin' a look at them right now.
He prays to god that his luck will improve,
I always knew this day would come.
Dang, Beef! How long I been asleep for?
A violin, dude.  Hold on.
Whoah. I call bullshit on that one.
EEEEEEAAAUGH!
It feels like a bee damn stung me on my Gentleness!
Get out here! French me!
A steak.
Who the hell are you two!
Oh, use your website? Yeah, I'll just use your website. Nice.
I think that at the end of the joke the bartender's life is screwed up pretty bad. He doesn't have a lot of options.
"Steve's Party"?! I can't get off to this!
(crying) Oh my god I'm so sorry I just didn't want us to miss the entrance!
Man, our drink has a PASSWORD? That is JAMES BOND IN A TOWEL! What other perks breast men get?
I ain't goin' there alone, because I don't want to, and you're tight with that Nice Pete creep he keeps around.
Here!  He says town's just a mile or so further.
Holy hell, that is so old school!
But... but if you're Uncle Culpepper, then who's this?
Dang, man! A Jehovah's Witness! Let me get the hose.
Don't... don't take any!
He's not happy with the logo. He says it needs more "jazz."
We got us some finger ticklers, a jimmy hat, a coin you flip that says sex-related stuff on both sides...
Oh, that's right. I guess I did.
Oh...hey.  Listen -
Here, gimme a hit off that.
I found some old Thompson Twins tapes taht we can use to listen to!
What? Are there any sluts at my house?
(thinking) So this is a classic struggle.
No, don't cry!
[[to himself]] Crap, man! I ain't want to go out and be Pat's acid guide! I got Mad Max all cued up on the DVD. And plus I have been wanting to drink beer.
Huh?  What?  Fool, don't get arthroscopic surgery tonight!
No, they got to sign it, 'cause you need 'em buyin' new ones.
Oh, no way! You're Bono's butler? Nice to meet you! I mean, I know it's the  phone and all, but-
Yo T!  Can you run over to my place and find the Empire Voice Donut that is probably sittin' whereever Roast Beef dumbly - you're there?  Awesome, man.  Simply awesome.
I do zees... in ze name of Bastille.
I wrote a gay romance novel, dude! Might be the first of its kind! Hella valuable, dude!
Heh! Thanks!
Wow, Hawaii!
OH I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER DOCTOR KISSES
Look, I'm gonna hide my cel in this fake beard I'm wearin', and put it on speakerphone.  Use the Donut to be a desert oil prince and have a conversation with Tina where you seduce her, dig?
Heh! Somethin' about that little fruit really touched the sex receptacle in my brain! I still feel weird about it.
Phillippe, you are rad!
Got to get my Lovely Twelve, hoss. That's just the way this one honest man plays the game.
That's right! It's the one John Lennon played on the Ed Sullivan show!
Ain't it great!
How come?
Huh! What finally put you over the edge?
Um... uh... one sec--
Yep, yep.  That'll do juuuuust fine.
You know, when somebody puts fruits and stuff in red wine! It's a mexican thing. It represents the blood of Christ or something.
Don't say nothin'! Just have a drink on your old friend Ray!
If you like the Web well then fine you can have it!
You're probably right.  Here, I'll try to get a reasonable word.
Hey Cornelius! you writin' the captions for the Spice channel these days?
Hm. I'll need to know what that is.
THE DUDE HAS ICKY MOVES
Drabble, dumbass! YOU!
A little bit punk, a little bit BMW!
DO CORRECT DIRT ACTIVITIES! HAVE A WORM WITH A YARN HAT POKE OUT AND PURCHASE ANTI-WORM CREDITS!
Pat was so mean to Roast Beef over the years that Beef finally flew himself into outer space!
Alright, T!
Yeah, I kick a couple bricks his way now and then.  Don't talk during my swing.
(thinking) ...hmmmmm...what can I do in a year...
I don't have time to debate what makes a friendship meaningful. Get into this. Three... two...
Huh! that sounds like how Cornelius writes!
That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen!
TIGHT AS A DRUM! SNAP SNAP! LISTEN TO MY DRUM SONG!
What?! Why you need Tic-Tac, Pat?
I got issues with a dish I'm makin'.
Heh heh! You got any lady-bots for us?
What brand is it anyway?
What's up, man? You ain't left the house since you came back! I mentioned this!
AAAUGH!
Look, that's Butters, on the left. Look how proud he is of his eyes.
Screw you guys.
Hey Vlad!  You know anything about this club called Haunches?
So long, fellows. No colonoscopy for me today. I got business to attend to.
Yeah, I'm callin' to register for the 2006 Great Outdoor Fight.
Jesus, kid! You catch on nice and slow, don't you!
Agreed. I had no plans.
This dude snuck into my house!  He took a secret picture of me on the can!
Neat!  Where'd he go?
I...yeah. You think he's 'a be pissed at me for not doin' things his way?
Actually, they can.
The Taliban bartender is like, "Man, I just have got to know what that's all about! I mean, the bird thing!"
Nice. Alright, time to film me bustin' through the wall and yellin' at him. Then you can edit this all together, yeah?
Blue curacao with Styrofoam peanuts! Ha ha!
They ran some samples through a computer and it turns out he sing perfectly, every time! Wake the dude up and stick him with a pin, chances are it's a hit!
This was gonna get sprinklered on if I didn't find it!
My PEPPER, man!
I... AM... RUUUDE!
Ich liebe meine Kultur
Well, there was this thing at minigolf courses where doo-wop guidos* and sniffle-tip cholos** couldn't behave, and used the nice metal putters to bang on the mini-golf landscape as well as each other.
Uh...you can sponsor their Chain of Behavior ID cards. Three saw-bucks each.
Does Jack White get into the bed?
Hey Lyle, you in there?  Let's go get some suds!
Yeah, is Bono there?
You... you know. Like, planned, with a note. Like that genius kid in the New Yorker article a little while back. I read part of it in Beef's bathroom once. Hella long. Beef is real, REAL smart.
Daaamn, man.  Last week I read the same story, only it was a virgin chimp got knocked up.
You know what the problem with gay porn is?  I'll tell you.  Look at these titles...
Pat, Ray again! I think it can handle donkey milk, if you still doin that vegan thing! BA-DUMP BUMP! Rim shot! Heyo!
Oh, that's right!
This can't be right.  Feels kinda unsafe.
One...two...three...
Yeah, thing shoots Bensington the way he thinks of himself, not the way he really is.
LYYYYLE! New day! New DAAAY!
Well, you're both gonna be bloggin' this Fight through a tube in your face if you don't get me Sound and Motion.
You damn right it ain't wise!  Sit down and listen!  I thought you had a biography to write!
EVERYBODY DANCE
But it's all scientific and clever!  You love that stuff!
Man, that is one hell of a beautiful color.
Just Philippe, but we told him the metal undies were part of a game we were playin'.
Oh!  I'm sorry to hear that!
Okay...but still - pretty cool, huh!
You guys do that too?  I thought it was just old cats!
Man, you know French people got it light on the face! I can't help if it's on the thin side!
(still crying) Slow down man here are at Wendy's slow down SLOW DOWN oh my god!
I can't believe you made us take this stanky sheet!  What are we gonna DO with it?!
Here, I'm going to put a big plastic cup where my phone holder is, and you pour water into it one ounce at a time.  I'll notice how I feel as the cup gets heavier.
Do you think that was really your dad?
Whoah, can't Todd read?
Hey Marmaduke!  Did you dig a hole today?  Huh?  Did you eat someone else's food?  Did you behave in a disobedient fashion?
Whoah, Todd! What the hell?
No teenage boy has ever done anything wise near a lake.
Yo, Beef. Ray here. Just wanted to say thanks for lookin' after me last couple of weeks.
That's why Teodor looks like some blowjob from the Banana Republic ads, and Beef looks like a goon who lost his jack-off virginity in the bathroom at Comic-Con
Pat?  Yeah, Ray here.  I made us up a prototype.
Paper, clocks, glasses...Chinese. I ain't be at all surprised if there's some Ming vase out there with a picture of some emperor's cell phone goin' off in the movie theater.
I just want to make a copy! I listened to mine so much I wore it out!
...daaaaamn...
Well, one afternoon about seven months ago, this gay Taliban lawyer walks into a bar with a talking parrot on his shoulder.
(on phone) hey Teodor, man, it's Ray
Listen... first you just stick your tongue out...
Yeah, man.  We ahd to come up with disclaimers out the wazoo.  Here's just one page of 'em:
He's not dead...he's not dead...I...we brawled...he's fine, he ha stuff for his album....
I come bustin' down the wall and complain about how poorly some fat guy's playing with himself, there's no gay OR straight appeal! It's just every fat dude's worst nightmare come to life!
So I get all on that aisle with the hippie pills and stuff, only someone had totally just cut the cheese there and ditched.
Oh! Uh...hold on...uh...
Now let's follow with a bit of a twist, our fennel ale. It'll remind you of a ginger ale, but it clocks in at 6.8%.
Hey Garfield! Is this Garfield?
Somethin' he gets from that illegal doctor he drinks with.
Oh neat! Fifty bucks!
Dang, Beef! ComCast ain't fixed your cable internet yet?!
three... two...
Dude made me a fortune on Wall Street last year.
Hello?
Look, I'll pay you sixty bucks. Total sideline. Just... write down exactly what happened at that mansion.
...we'll start the ghostwriter on the tell-all now, and get bidding going on the other 50% of the footage for when he croaks. Any good executive can spot a cokehead. A great one can make him a Belushi.
Hoochie mama wanna-bling always matches the baby count, dogg. Street thinkers call it Tight Math.
THIS AIN'T PERSONAL!
How's he lookin, Dr. Andretti? He's gonna be okay, right? Just like last time?
shit what dude when?!
He SAID he was gonna do it!
Huh? Oh, whoops!
Hey man, what time is he gonna let us in?
Teodor. If you saw a kid wearing metal underpants, would you assume that something important was going on?
You're bangin' a website, but whatever.  No cookies for you.
What if I go creamy too? A clause, man! That's all! Nurses are to tuck us in on the TV room couch under a big puffy quilt that says, "Just Some Knuckleheads From The Day!"
Heh! I don't think he even proposes until Volume 8!
Why you think moms always hire clowns for they kids' parties?! Kids hate clowns! But Moms know that a clown packs!
Does your mom even know what Neiman Marcus is?
Now why don't you just try again!  I know you can do better!
Well, if that's true, how come most Chinese guys are just average strength? I mean, look at black dudes. Hella strong, yet mainly eat normal stuff like burgers or cake. No way you'd catch a brother squattin' by a river, nibblin' on a snake face.
They wanna pair it up with this footage of a dog who barfs out a lotta candy near a CEO.
Why you chose to watch me during toilet time says a lot about you!
Dear Diary,
So...uh...thanks for everything, I guess
What in hell are you talkin' about?! Didn't you see this hat?
It's like, when a guy in traffic is honking, in a way he is actually *crying out for his own dong!*
You already made us a logo?  Let me see!  Heh!  Man, I can't BELIEVE you were burnin' one at the same time as me.  This is hideous!
Alright, fellas.  I'ma think out loud here.
You know what we oughta do on this road trip?
Where are we?
Well BLAH blah BLAH blah BLAH blah BLAH!
Why's that hot dog chef keep pointin' us out to everybody?
What?  What is it, Lassie.com?!
I chartered a special flight home with Todd!
Yeah, yeah, I'ma be there.  For reals, cognac-large.
What you talkin' about some boy named Baba O'Riley!  Ain't no parent in this day got no kid named at ALL Baba O'Riley!
What, someone slip some acid into your cod liver oil?
Alright, Philippe! Where we goin'?
Heh heh!  Yeah, yeah, my breeder used to show me in my early days.
I'm serious this time, Beef! I ain't gonna be able to pee unless you look right in my eyes!
Say it! You don't even try anymore!
Daaamn!  Look at this, Teodor!
Email!  Large!  I love that stuff!
Do that immediately. I'll queue up Braveheart and see if there is a bottle of Blue Label in my hand.
Some Ketel One extra dry, baby! DRY AS THE DICKENS!
The Death Sound.
I better go back inside before Miramax casts Michael Flatley to play me in the movie!
[after another pause] TODD!  TODD!
How do you know?
Alright Connie, I need a Todd bio written. You think you got two hundred pages in you?
What if someone finds it?!  They could test for my DNA!
He's at the top of his game!
It's Envelope, dogg. Guy across the street. He parked on his damn lawn again.
...So like it ain't bad enough that Little Nephew got himself the Stone Cold F Grade in History this quarter...
It's cool, man. It'll probably...
Daaamn!
Listen -- I just have a quick question for you!
I don't like fighting either. Get there first.
You want to go on a little mini-vacation to paradise?  Come look in my toilet, dude!
Dang, Roast Beef! You called like forever ago!
Cooome and get it! Come get your fresh public wine!
It recently came to our attention that Achewood is not handicap-accessible!
Sorry massive little man, but this is how the game is played...
Why? Because the Achewood book is finally done, that's why!
[[To Teodor]] They say that's a good sign.
I got Vegetable Brain! Can you believe it?!
You shouldn't eat that stuff, Philippe. Candy bars are hell of hinge on the body.
It's the Kermit the Frog Master Memory Challenge!  Happy birthday, little man!
Hold on now. This ad has a PICTURE of me? Doin' what?
Alright men, the correct answer was C, the ZZ Top Eliminator.
Turns out roller skatin' is the best type of exercise there is!
Heh! I don't think you EVER went off a jump without crackin' your cashews!
This's mine dude! Don't be buggin'!
Hey, T!  Whatchu doin' round my pad?  I'm light, dogg.  Serious times.  Smoke up a friend, holmes.  I'm so bored.
Anyhow, I'm going to put my half of phone call through to Ray's house so you can work things out. BEEP HISSS buhWOOOOP!
Hey, Beef!  Letter came for Showbiz!  What's goin' on?
(thinks) This is my call-up!
The Guy on eBay said it might take a few minutes for our primal instincts to kick back in, dude! Just stick with it! ... ROAR!
Don't move me!
Beef, I think you know what this dude needs.
Hey, sorry 'bout that. Yeah. Ramada Inn, by the airport, room 215. Thanks.
You know, I used to know a guy who got AIDS once. It was a pretty rough scene.
Oh DAMMIT my cell phone is dead!  WHY I don't never charge my damn cell phone?  WHY must I live like a fool?!
Silent Bird Wallace, mute as he was, paired up with Alosius, a stone-deaf and illiterate singer with the most beautiful voice anyone had ever heard.
Even though he was from a high school where students freely discussed orgasm and jazz music in the hallways --and the teachers were always stoned--
The mint really bridges the gap between the herb and the hops.
I mean, his rhymes are alright, but this only signature move is a crotch-grab. Yeah, I know. That's Michael's move. Everybody knows that.
UHN!
Don't distract me, Pat. Accidents. Crashes. A family is changed forever.
Todd! God damn you! Get back here with my thong!
The dude had skills. He got me so jazzed, I bought three more hats and a big rubber California.
[[To Lazarus]] Look at them, wastin' all their time playin' on the computer!
'Round about a year back, I bought a cell phone off a loco street player -- had to make a quick call. Call went fine, but then weird stuff started happenin'
Heh! Yeah. Religion, man. That is some messed-up stuff.
Let's just say there's a cumshot at my house, and I didn't put it there.
(yelling over static) What's that, Roast Beef?  I can barely hear you!  Phone's crappin' out!
Quaid wasn't even IN Twister.
Teodor, when you talk that way, I feel like I'm sitting on the nozzle of a big metal tank that says YALE.
You're tellin' me! I must have got my Bone on six times yesterday.
The hell look at all that mayhem. Damn sloppy fightin' if you ask me.
Wade!  Stop it! This man is trying to be nice to you!
E-mail that totally good question to me. You are completely smart to ask that. Next?
What's it look like, Daddy-O?
Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. How do I get a group to follow me after that, though?
This is the chance of a lifetime!
Of COURSE you know me, dude! I brought a twelver of Asahi to your birthday last month!
I know you like to read Nate Small and all, but when you ever been in any single fight?
You are a rad friend!
Well, like, Envelópe Martinez has a bunch of cars and Christian fundamentalists on his lawn.  It's bad for property values, man.  Precedent.
(thinking) Dang. HELLA emotional. This is a million-seller
Ass In Your Pants,
I mean STADIUM EVENT. Think Woodstock, baby. A festival of love and respect, long overdue in our land. Can you dig it?
(Thinking) Ancient player like him gonna dig on a young dude offerin' some tie-tac-and-wingtip respect. Fogeys CRAVE respect. They sit up late and WANT it.
Y--yes. Yes I am.
I-Teodor! Don't sass me when I'm grumpy! I'll have you slayed!
I'M SO SO SORRY
...and the very next day a horny mailman shows up.
Yeah, man! He's busting out all kinds of jokes on the audience right now!
The HELL that's what it means!  YOU'RE a MORON!
Let me guess.  You're a cynical dyke who always needs coffee and talks about coffee.
UNPH!
Daaamn! Man, this is special!
Man, I thought you'd like that place!
Oh, yeah, I thought it might be kinda fun.
Alright, so what's the deal with the turkeys and brandy today? Is it like a buffet, or is it table service? And what about them side dishes?
Mom!
Whatcha got.
Dude, "A," the Airwolf cockpit has one-way glass...
This show stone cold blows!  I'm gonna go outside and have a smoke.
What's all this, Todd?
You a crazy person, Beef. Go to a dungeon.
Nerdy bitches on speed?
Hey, everybody! Ray Smuckles here on a beautiful Fuck You Friday! That's right, take old Fuck You out for a spin today. You'll be glad you did!
(thinking) Or do I play the game as it is played and call it survival of the fittest?
Cornelius! Get in! you're old and you gonna do urine on yourself!
Oh! Uh...
This is it?!
In case we ain't got enough skeleton bones to eat down at the graveyard! Duh!
Seriously! Can you imagine if a chick heard me talkin' abour RAID arrays? Her tits would fall off and roll under the couch! Her uterus would shut like an airlock!
Maybe...maybe pour it into a glass. Wait. Maybe...drink it!
How the hell did you get into the Fight, Beef?!
So this is our Meyer Lemon Weissbier. Note the delicate clove aftertaste.
...GOT to have some kind of sound system...
Suit yourself, stacky! I'ma sugarfoot MY hella shinto movements straight on back to the Time Tunnel!
The HELL you say! I got better things to do then stand around the forest all sober on hick tipple!  We LEAVIN'!
I don't care what this reporter says, Andre Agassi is butt ugly!
Serious?
I...I'm talkin' physical therapy! Wheelchairs and stuff! Speakin' at high schools!
The only thing I'm takin' to the election is an angry little brain that stores Canadian history in a molecule next to fruit names. Get away from me.
We TALKED about this!
I'm waiting for you to make this worth my while. Most any dude in the game would know to get his subject juiced so that he'll talk.
Well ALL FUCKIN' RIGHT, man! Just come into the goddamned house already!
Dang, look at that bling! Congratulations! I KNEW he was gonna pop the question this week!
You got to be kiddin' me. You need me to sign a form and FAX it back in?
Can you believe I ran a damn mile?
You know how much hip-hop I listen to. How come I never heard of pimp skitters?
Hey man, it's Ray. I'm sorry I said that I boned your brother-in-law
How come you kids are so GOD DAMNED stupid and just do the stupidest thing possible every SINGLE SECOND OF THE GOD DAMNED DAY!
I'm gonna foot the whole thing, from the Save the Dates to the bridesmaids' morning-after pills!
Listen, T, do you think we can use that computer of yours to whip me up a CD?
Okay, cool.  How do you test it to make sure it works?
So, basically, it's good that you're coming with me.  I'll go fire up the Escalade.
Cathy...
Cool! Fun!
I had a good run, Beef. I'll always remember it. But hair is like Johnny Cashâ It only exists to let you know you're dyin'.
MOMMMM! ROAST BEEF WANTS TO KISS GIRLS ON THE TITTIES!
(Typing) Judi watched through the crack in the door as Inge, her Swedish au pair, snapped the top of a thigh-high stocking into place. She found herself overcome with the desire to inhale the natural fragrance of the tender white skin between her freshly bathed breasts.
Me? Hells naw, man.  I ain't wantin' to get too tight with that Nice Pete dude.
Hello, TÃ©odor.  This is Ray Smuckles calling to tell you about a...
Seriously, Pat! How'd you get outta prison?
You hear that, Beef? Perfect!
God damn.  What can I do to class up this cornbread mix.
That Right Stuff bomber jacket is gonna put you through college, young man!
Oh, and I'm gonna bring some Sunny D in case there ain't enough blood to go 'round.
I wish I could, but dude, I get like fifty emails an hour from people!
Yeah, so I guess we got seperated last night.  I was pretty turned around.
Vegas.  The Talented Dr. Sniffles just gave his bad self a whale tail-ectomy on the sharpened corner of an Emeril Lagasse franchise.  Back in three.
Roast Beef, you could see a rainbow turnin' out badly!
Well, okay, but there's still a hair in my nachos.
Go ahead, say it.
TODD! PLEASE DO NOT PLAY TWO DIFFERENT SONGS ON TWO DIFFERENT STEREOS AT THE SAME TIME!
I DECLARE MYSELF... BROADICUS DICKUS!
Just make it fun to watch!  That's all people want!  Just make it a party!
Hey Teodor. You been workin' on Philippe's campaign? You look a little stressed.
Well, she's a stripper so you ain't exactly got to look like one of those dudes from the Dutch Masters box.
Okay then. Well. What I typically offer entrepreneurs at this stage is guidance, and maybe a tiny seed, or "angel," investment.
Hey, doggie!
[waits]
"Hecho en Mexico." I knew it. The market is flooding with Magical mexican realism products these days.
Alright, China. You drive a hard bargain. I'll give you the idea for spaghetti, but let the women and children go. I don't care what happens to me.
All my life I been gettin' shit for the hours I keep. I ain't understand why gettin' up so early is so goddamned great.
'Member how I was idiotic the last two weeks? I had a realization--there ain't no romance novels for actual idiots!
Was some gay magician havin' a garage sale?
Daaamn, Pat!  I didn't know you were gonna be at the video store!  Whatchu gettin'?
Water is full of nutrients! That's all I'm trying to say!
I was thinkin' of settin' up a little indoor basketball court and posing them on it.
Huh? Oh--it's about what would have happened if Washington and Lincoln had met!
Whoah, I call bullshit on that one.
Dear S.D., It's funny: at first this letter sounded like kind of an insult to me.
Here's five hundred dollars. Don't spend it all in one place, unless that place is your nose.
What?!  No, mom!  Ain't nobody got diabetes here!  I promise!
I just decided this.
Yo Dilbert!  How's your coffeebert?  You gettin' pizzabert for lunchbert?  You ever wish you'd never chained yourself to certain dopey suffixberts?
Oh, fuck!  I must have dropped my medallion back in the car! Oh god please let that be where it is please please PLEASE please please!
Todd! How dare you have a terrible cocaine addiction at Philippe's birthday party!
Who's this underage knockoff with his store bought opinion?
Lyle could catch it with a lacrosse stick or butterfly net.
I was just about to get a little bit twisty on Jager and chilly Stellas! Sounds like you oughta join me!
What the fuck are you talkin' about? You're the biggest asshole I know!
So, Lyle! What's with all the new Subways in town?
We got mimosas, rib-eyes, glasses, plates...anything you want, mom. Really.
Look at that!  Only 240 miles home!  You gonna be hungry before we get there?
Alright, I had a little Gallup poll run.
Hold on! Do you think these questions might just be from little kids?
The most hardcore Chinese make-you-strong "delicacy" ever. And yeah, I'm gonna make it.
Scientific, though.
Bye, Todd! Have fun and get better, 'kay!
HEY!  HOW MUCH FOR THE DANCIN' SANTA?
Dressing up like cowboys just isn't... just isn't cheering me up at all.
And remember, I didn't show this to you, 'cause you didn't see it. I'm nervous just havin' this thing around.
How is it insulting to know facts. Think about what you're saying, then pick up where you left off. Three... two...
Verily, as did I.
Really!
Oh you should see it, Beef! The delivery actually starts a second train in motion!
Yeah, uh, I didn't do that. I'm more of a "rent a pony" kind of guy.
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that! Listen-I just have a quick question for!
I didn't care about Spanish! I was a red-blooded male wth a whole lotta love to give!
Rustmouth died peacefully, aged 106, wealthy and well-respected, surrounded by family and friends. The police even named a street after him. Silent Bird died young. Hungry and half-crazed with lice, he put himself under a train one night. They buried him in two caskets.
Says here you mash up the dad on some toast, and put the daughter under an upturned glass to watch.
No, I DON'T know how it is with Wikipedia! Why ain't you fuckin' TELL me how it is with Wikipedia, Teodor? 'Cause THAT's neat!
Meg? Baby.  PLEASE don't sell my mama's milk, PLEASE don't sell my mama's cheese. PLEASE, baby girl. >
Okay, uh huh, right. I, uh...Ray loves you too.
Man, let's get out of here!
They were droppin' off my new Damon and Affleck!
Oh man, don't start in with Samuel H. Invisible.
Enough with the computer mumbo-jumbo, already!  What are you doin'?
Ask yourself, what would really set a taco stand apart from the rest?
So, like, what's it you do, here?
Pat! Me and the rest of the boys are pitchin' in and gettin' Roast Beef and Molly a forty-eight state minigolf RV tour for their honeymoon!
[[Whispering]] up yours Garfield
What in the hell?! [[he's opened a package, which is beside him now, and is reading a piece of paper]]
noooOOOOOO!
With extreme prejudice! High-pressure lemon juice, private white vans, de-federalized BMX black ops riders. The best of the best. You've touched a nerve, journalist!
I... dude! You can't end this here! I got a hot nut on loan from Hell! Write the rest! NOW!
Her new husband? You mean the new husband that I...
Yeah, man! Take your time! I know how it is.
Naturally, you need to diversify your product line a bit.  Create a price-point spectrum.
Interesting.  Okay, on a scale of one to ten, I need you to do a skit where you wear nylons and...and drink from a chamber pot.
Alright, dudes! What celebrities we gonna have crashin' through the wall of our gay porn set?
No way, dude. Last time I called a prostitute she didn't wear enough deodorant and I couldn't make anything happen. What if I get the same one? Or what if I have a reputation?!
Well, I just think you're a jerk!  How about that?!
Anybody, Wade!
Ah yes. I was thinking about the Tournedos Bordelaise.
Oh, yeah. James Bond is the 'mackinest.
I... I keep blackin' out and fallin' down, Doc! I think it's quick-onset diabetes!
(thinking) This could easily toe the line between Nobel Prize and prison time.  I GOT to find out if I can spin this as humanitarian.  What's the firm that changed Paris Hilton from cocksucking dumbo to entrepreneur who did not send the whole world an MPEG of her sucking cock?  They're good.
It seems like there is a difference between e-mail and internet? Is that right?
THE SEMEN OF THE DEMON ICED THE DEATH-CAKES ONE BY ONE!  THE LOYAL MAIDENS SERVED THEM AND SOON SATAN'S JOB WAS DONE!
"Perforate a condom with a hole punch to make the perfect container for a bouquet garni."
How do you think plants get so big on it?
The grooves are spaced out so that when your wheels roll over them in succession, a song is played.
You were all like Â¡Hola Juan! Â¡Yo reado dos math books! I was in my 4-Runner makin' whale music with Mary-Anne Feldman!
Huh. Let's seeâ¦ I think the 22' Jackhammer Subwoofer I just put in the Escalade. It's 6,000 watts.
Internet Explorer all displaying job listings from Monster.com...
Ha ha, motherfucker. Listen, I got to fruit up this Bullshit Sunrise because you have set up the most baloney mini-bar of all time.
Oh man no no he ain't got to do this twice in one night!
What are you gigglin' about, Beef? Good Lord!
Special report I should see, huh. Well, nothin' doin'. Like I said, I'm pretty busy.
Easy, dude. I was readin' the instruction manual while you were takin' your time climbin' the rope ladder to the heela-copter.
Okay, hold on. I gotta grab a pen.
(off-panel) There will be room for all my babies, right?
Yeah, operator? Get me American Idol television program at Fox TV company in probably Los Angeles or New York.
And this just in:
So, like, the king used to have someone taste his food to make sure it wasn't poison, you know?
I'm glad you agree, man! We gonna make a mint!
Dude! You ain't supposed to show me up in front of my dad!
Yeah, I know how to make one of those.
Holy dang! It's Christmas Eve! I completely forgot!
Well, I'll help you on one condition, Turtleneck Tom.
Well, he's breathin', but his ass cheek and brain are hella stabbed.
Heh! Probably not, but maybe?
We gotta get you that allergy bracelet, and have them pump your butt all full with vaccine shots!
Downtown, huh. Daylight?
Huh? Oh! Oh yeah! First-ever pitched in the stoned slow-pitch softball league!
Can't we prank Cathy TOMORROW? I'm tired.
[thinking, smaller text] ...I'd probably just wind up makin' a damn fool of myself again
Nice. That'll be a fun car for B Junior to have at college. You're a good dad, Bill.
I don't know what that means
They got such a thing?
A few scholarly works state that he claims to have had the first group sex in America â though recently unearthed wax recordings have him saying that he didn't much like it. Here, I have 'em on my iPod.
Who pulled the string on this cliched hip hop minion?
(sobbing) What the fuck is the matter with me, man? I'm serious!
So how'd you get the name Roast Beef, anyway?
Listen, Edison.  Why ain't we redoctor this ketchup so it erases those memories...and instead, maybe, he develops an amazing career as a shirtless Irish jump-dancer?
Huh? Oh, some pilot called America's Most Harmed Animals.
SImon! Hey, man, nice watch! That Paco Rabanne?
Woah, you guys buy your tortilla chips at the damn [i]store?[
Roast Beef!  Why are you programming that computer?
He made nachos later.  He called them "Galaxy Nachos"?  Is that a certain recipe?  They were so tasy that I wished I had made them instead of him.  I really need to get in control of this.
Okay then, mom! Scripture Cake it is! See you Sunday morning!
Ain't nobody else on the Acres gettin' solids.
Teodor! I need you to be-
Ain't see why.
Someone gets sassy after he hacks a big old website!
That's right, Dr. Andretti!  Right up old Thermometer Lane!  Heh heh!
Oh, this?  Diabetes, man!  Gonna beat the D in oh-three-plus-three!
About a pound.
"Hencho en Mexico." I knew it. The market is flooding with Magical mexican realism products these days.
Hm. We gotta get this in front of a focus group.
[[thinking, and smiling]] Goodbye, Butters.  See you in the dreams of chubby female real estate agents who have had menopause.
I'm talkin' sleepin' with the fishes!  Cement shoes!
So how's it goin', Pat? You scorin' much dude-pussy these days?
We've got to help him!  Society shits on the elderly!  Someone has to care!  Pull over!
No, man. We shavin' our heads and curbin' a mussel.
Threadville...white mud...the old limestone quarry!
BATTER UP!
So... I'm glad you're not bleeding. Just got a nasty cocaine thump on your chest?
Oh Rudy! Your hair's a mess, your shirt is dirty, and daddy gets home in ten minutes! If we make you look like his girlfriend, though, maybe he'll be really nice to you! Maybe he'll take you to HIS room!
Really? How come?
Yum, man!
But what if the food taster knew to only eat a certain part that didn't have poison in it? What if it was a cahoots-type situation?
Dude, no worries! I landed someone to warm up the crowd!
...yeahhhh. But now that it's comin' so real, I'm startin' to think he's just gonna be less and less in my life.
Whoah!  Who understands this font?  Is this one for blind people?
You gotta hack into Yahoo and delete this ad, Beef!
Just...It needs to get dressed. Please.
As such, we are taking some cost-cutting measures. I've crossed the following items off of our budget:
Yeah, we cruised through it at lunchtime.  Still worth a second look, though.
Téodor! This is Robert Smith, from The Cure! I am their main singer! How are you, dogg?
Pat, you've been to prison more times than the neck tattoo fairy, yet you got on worst with Miami.
My mom just called, dude.  I got to pick her up at the airport.  Back in fifty, cool?
So I just download it and it gets all the problems away?
Heh! Okay, little guy! Hop on in and we'll have us an adventure!
Oh, hey Pat! What's cookin?
[[Talking into telephone]]  That's right, sir.  Based on how much eggs or milk you started with.  Could I interest you in a trial version?
Kids, always sleep stoned!
HEY Roast Beef! Order us summore drinks! I'm gonna go hit the can!
Damn, Cornelius!  You get shot down by any more women and we're gonna have to make a drinkin' game outta this!
When we say "perfect," we mean, like, Swiss, you know?
You know me, dude. I'm straighter than John Wayne voting for Reagan on a horse.
Okay, hi everybody. Listen, recently my friend shot my car.
Right, right.
I heard you did so much coke in the 80s that you nipples turned into scabs and fell off!
I have 34 AIBOs.
Whoah, whoah.  "Decent intellect"?  I didn't mean groan because she won't stop yappin' about Kofi Annan!
...it'll probably scab over.
Says fuckin' who?!
Holy...holy *crap*!  I feel wonderful!  Holy CRAP!
Hair falls off my body and sometimes there is gas!  Jesus, use your imagination!
Thank you.  That is always nice to hear.
Uh, Beef?
Yeah, my cousin told me how to find it!
DO YOU WANT SOME FRITTATA?
Anyhow, here's the letter.
This equation just came to me when I cleared my mind, man.
Dogg! What if, in prehistoric times, everyone had large dongs?
No, man. You can't pre-win a contest. There got to be an event.
Damn, good idea!  How about we promise that as long as Philippe's president, all homeless people can stay at Motel 6?  My treat!
Make it a large. My biographer's here.
Damn, talk about the missing link! Havin' that weight hangin' there is totally releasin' wonderful hormones in my brain!
Yeah, yeah, of course.  I think I got my best ones out on loan though.
Oh man, I am gonna get six kinds of nasty on a Cold Cut Trio!
Well I'll be! It looks like someone taped over it! Oh well! Who wants a drink?
Yeah, I get that folks leave for work at seven 'cause we ain't used to have light bulbs at night, but it's been like a hundred damn years.
Man, those guys got gone and stayed gone!  You ain't leavin' here 'til you knock down this lineup 'a Cragganmore, dogg.
Heh.  Yeahhhhh.  Just got it back from the printer.
What do you mean you want off the show, Beef?
Hey!  The only Bell around here is over in Threadville!
Look, I ain't interested in no Capital One card.
Todd! Don't use the phone.  This ain't that kind of company.
Hipster? What? Why'd you say that?
Man, fuck those guys! The hell they're gonna say how this Fight is won! [[Ray shakes his fist at the observation booth]] BRING ON THE JEEPS, GOD DAMN YOU!
Shall what?  Shall suck at being entertaining?  Too late, pal!
Hey Beef, you had dinner yet?
Not too easy now! I am a great man, but I am not a good man, doctor.
Well, first of all you got to have sexual relations!  You can't get in alone!
Teodor! Don't you know Circus Penis?
I... Jesus. Real, real fast, right?
That's pathetic.  You talkin' 'bout Kahlua cock or somethin'.  Sapporo schlong.  If Jack Daniel's makes you anything less than the man with abilities in his pants, then I don't even want to know you.
...ALWAYS run the sink if you think I might be home...
Lemme give you my Visa, we'll be all wrapped up here.
Alright, Beef!  So you know more about computers than I do!  YOu gonna hold it against me?
Dude! Waldenbooks keeps their extra Playboys in a little cabinet right by the entrance! You just slide open the door and walk out with one rolled up in your hand!
Damn, they did that in your family too? My great aunt used to mix that up for my Uncle GÃ©rard!
Getting' drunk under the stars, fryin' up sausages!
I'm sittin' on the damn stoop! You're the one who turned it into a war and a musical!
Man, we just shootin' the breeze!  Two old dudes who known each other since milk money days!  Why's that off the table?
The oldest dude in the world is always Chinese. If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'!
Ain't it illegal to leave stoned people lyin' around in public? Let's put him in the cart.
Actually, I was thinkin' more old school know-how.  Like, how to properly clean your belly button.  Who ever really got taught?
A LITTLE tacky?! Not replacin' the empty toilet paper roll is a LITTLE tacky.
Gettin' drunk under the stars, fryin' up sausages!
Damn, dude! What just happened? Did I black out?
Happy Birthday, Onstad.
Yeah! I felt like burnin' one in my hot tub and listening to the Police! I miss doin' that! Doesn't that sound great? Scampi and lamb burgers on the grill?
Yaaaaaaawn!  Yawn yawn yawny-yawn!
Man, what is goin' on with Roast Beef? I ain't never seen him put it away like this!
*Doggz 2 Tha Bizzone!*
Why, I didn't even think you liked that kind of stuff!
What kind of wedding would you want if you ever got married, Beef?
And the celebrities, they're not as good as real celebrities. They all look like middle-school teachers who don't know about conditioner.
Thanks for this, Doc. I just wasn't sure I'd ever have the chance, you know?
Yes.
Each of you must approach him. If he snarls and growls, he considers you a chump.
You gettin' the nutmeg and honey finishing notes?
So now you're in The Byrds?
Anything, doc. Whatever you think is necessary.
"Three days! Three acres! Three THOUSAND men! Only one will win THE GREAT OUTDOOR FIGHT!"
YOU know you got to talk gentle to tiny plants to help them grow!
Dude, I can't just read somethin' and "know" it. I'm one of those guys who learns best by doin'.
Let's see... let's breathe a bin 281 for the meats but start off with a Jouet.
Why you watchin' the Spice channel with closed captioning on, Beef?
Hey hey! Looks like we finally found downtown!
Dang, Lyle! You openin' up a taco stand?
Next time you're over I'll show you my video of these secret soccer trials they ran on gay dudes back in the 70s.  These guys make Pele look like a donkey with a helmet.
Whoah, who understands this font? Is it fro blind people?
I...I ain't really sure.
Daaamn. You KNOW they had to put these warnings on one lawsuit at a time.
How do you get her e-mail once you know that you like her? Do you just click on the picture?
Oh, man!  Your senior high school photo is just slayin' me, Beef!  Ha! Ha! Ha!
You didn't just say that. -- Anyhow, you got to be your own boss.  Start up a concern called Private Horizons.  Thank me later.
Simon! Hey, man, nice shirt! That Tommy Bahama?
Jesus Christ, already! I'm afraid to buy a new dish sponge 'cause I might win a phone call from INXS! Man, I ain't got nothin' to say to those guys!
We got that angle, dogg. We already made him a pair.
And notice the internal calm you feel.
And this one time I even dressed up like a damn strawberry and sat in a big tub of cream!  ...wait, that wasn't her birthday.  I was all alone that night.
Me?! This car's for you, Beef!
I got MAD respect for you Roast Beef, but you are NOT gonna jump better than that! HOO-AH!
Come on, Beef. Don't be a drag. We talkin' 'bout a fun time here!
Uh huh. Uh huh.
Masterstroke, Lonis.
I...of course! Man, you act like I don't even know you.
Clear liquid-filled acrylic with a young Elvis...
What the... "Braveheart"?
I don't even know HOW to blubber!
This world ain't nothin' but bad news and the pills that go with it, and here you got a girl who's thinkin' about your Christmas present in March.
Beef!  You hear me?
I don't like Asahi either! It was on the Club Card, dammit! I was in a hurry!
(thinking) Highly melodic folk rock is long overdue for a comeback. Maybe I ought get him into the studio.
Mr. Bear is like Frasier - I know how you like Frasier!
You are terrible!
It's got like half a million settings, Beef! Hold on!
"Dear Mr. Williams, thanks for settin' me straight. It was a real honor to take a class from the master."
No, thank YOU Carrie!!
Huh! How's it work?
It's a Hot Put, dude! Happy Birthday!
OHHHHHHHH Man!  I'm so sorry, Beef!  I just ruined everything, didn't I?
holy fuckin' hell, Pat!  What are you doin' outta prison? What the shit?
Pat! Why'd you send me an "E-vite" just to come over for lunch?
It's a Hot Pot, dude! Happy Birthday!
Daaang!  Nice little ride Philippe!  Did you come on down here to sit session with the dirtiest dudes in town?
Don't listen to him. Disney rocked us.
Oh yeah, been meanin' to tell you. Gonna go fulfill my destiny down there.
How's this gonna work? Are we going to knock him out with bass, like that one villain in Krunkman Kronicles?
Fine, then!  Don't be any help at all!  BE completely a dick!
...once you get goin', don't stop, or you'll get maaaad...
Oh, police blotter. You make every newspaper a newspaper from Florida.
Hurry dude! The guy's gonna look over here!
Well, how much underwear DID you eat?
Man, he's driving like a 1979 Mustang with politics bumper stickers!  Ain't no fresh young daddy gonna spring into that thing.
Look, dude. I pay my bills. I ain't got pregnancies all over town. Where you get off actin' like I got to get up at six AM and eat a damn garbanzo bean?
Never almost have diabetes, dude.  It ain't no way to leave.
Fine then! Two can play at this game!
Roast Beef's income tax forms, completely blank, with a pencil next to them?
Hey mom, guess what! Roast Beef and I finally thought up a name for our rap company!
Dude, I am totally impressed with Cornelius. We should build him that old-school bus I was describin'.
Naw, man. It... he's the kind of dude where you don't call him unless, like, some junta executioner will only NOT junta-execute you if he can get proof that you're related.
Dang!  This is lookin' good, T!
Seriously, Beef!  You oughta go and get yourself a lady!
Let's do this! Let's do this!
I'll give you a hint: You should not be proud of your career!
Wow!  You wouldn't even drink it with your ass?  Now that must be some bad tea, my brother!
Oh. Well, this ain't that. It's just what's goin' on with me.
Ha ha! I's just kiddin' about all that.
Serious. Mom had a little burn on and dropped that my dad was Rodney Leonard Stubbs.
No it's not! No it's not! Everything's fine!
Do you want some tasty pizza, Little Nephew? I ordered us some Amici's!
Whoah, Beef!  You just went into labor!
"Steve's Party."
That's any late night skit show. Just air the parts that ain't about cocaine and selfish sex. Old industry secret.
Tell me, what are you wearing right now, Big R?
I got to have this with two other dudes at the same time?
So what! You noticin' the wrong things, Carmen San Diego!
Well, he ain much to look at but he's yours.
Still, man. Gladiators. Bear-baitin'. Stonin' women.
Yeah, it totally was a health person fart, exactly. It was even like more humid in that area.
Oh, and dude!  You should have seen Connie earlier!  Sayin' he was in some big hurry, all dressed in black, talkin' wistful about basic stuff like sounds...
Here, Doc. Join me in a prayer for him.
Dogg! Do NOT play with my merkin!
God, if he only knew...
Oh, I'm sorry. I know. Just a bad start to the day, is all. Cumshot. Sofa. Boom. Martha Stewart ain't chimin' in on that one.
It's like someone stuffed Alka-Seltzer between my brain cheeks!
Alright now - he's havin' his baby in my room.  Are you okay with that?
Listen here now, little mister! You ain't gettin' NO pizza so long as you walkin' around lookin' like Gay KISS!
What?  Oh, no man!  I got this on eBay!
PICK UP PICK UP PICK UP EBAY. TODAY IS THE DAY YOU PICK UP. PICK UP PICK UP PICK UP. EBAY PICK UP.
Well, I tell him to try somethin' new, and he thinks for a minute, but then he just does the same old crotch grab, only this time he'll like stamp his foot or puff out his cheeks. It's startin' to get frustrating.
Of course they'll let you on the plane! Just don't act like anything's wrong!
You HACKED your way into the Fight?
I got it on good authority that Harmony Kluxx and Dipitt Devine do a good show.
Did the government really steal all kinds of patents from him?
What if he actually likes this stuff?
Hey BEEF! You threw up! How come?
I'm actually pretty open minded once you get to know me.
What are you programming it to do?
Erotic wine tasting, dude. I'm in a club. Here, try this one...describe it, but lay on teh sekksy with a trowel.
It's okay, dad, Beef said he'd lay it down for me! I'm gonna drop him easy.
"A condom makes the ideal storage container for leftover risotto."
I BET her name was Michelle, dude!
Dude! That's IT! That's our ANGLE! Forget about the disguised cases!
Sheesh. Remember just watchin' Mr. Wizard?  I never gave diabetes a thought back then, man.  But now.
So, you guys hear the one about the priest who gave head to the mailman?
Hey Beef! You seen Uncle Culpepper around? He didn't come home last night!
Badass men do not mess around! They get down to business IMMEDIATELY!
Why are you making fun of me, mom?
Sorry Kev. Oh! Oh! That bubble-butt bartender! Talk about dumb! Heh-hey, don't get me wrong, I looooove dumb, but that was like "stick two  wires in her and she can power a clock" dumb. I mean, you ever seen a bartender thinks Heineken is wine?!
Yo Beef! Hey, man. Yo: did I, like, completely leave my medallion in the Volvo?
Hi Mom! Say, how do you spell "sandwiches"?
What I NEED is a steak sandwich so big it's got a snout at one end and a tail at the other! Four damn leg holes in the bun! Just walk it to the table and shoot it!
Thank you for calling Historical MoviePhone, where History Comes To Life. You have just won seven dollars, please hold.
Lie Bot!
So you got a cam on a dressed woman eatin' a sandwich in a mop closet?
(Typing) Boutiqua answered the door of the mansion. Prince Javier and Pinot were there in just shorts.
No. You got to have Massimo notice that the Handheld Popcorn Salter ain't in its charger. That'll add depth to his character.
Yo, Lyle! What's up? I'm kinda busy right now.
What?  Who is this?
It's like escorts, yeah, but instead of fingerless elbow-length gloves and gettin' in the bed, these boys show up "Crackin' OEs and Packin' PS3s."
Have you heard of Seka?
Baby seal, man.  Throat all caught in an Aqua Net six-pack yoke, flippers all lashed to its body by an unraveled mix tape titled "Tintern Supplicant"...
Aw, ain't no thang! Call me back after you try it, I want to know if I used too much cilantro.
Hey Marmaduke!  On your website it says that you can only get it on for like ten seconds, and if it isn't totally silent you lose your wood!
Would you drink...Earl Grey with your ass?
FOOD CHAIN! GET USED TO IT!
Daaamn. Look at this ad here, Beef. The strongest guy in the area says he'll come to your house and pick you up by your junk. One-handed.
HEY! Ain't no stewardesses gonna hear it digestin' in you, Todd! LISTEN TO ME! HEY! DO... DO NOT CUT IT OUT OF YOU! NO ONE CAN HEAR UNDERWEAR ONCE IT'S INSIDE OF YOU! TODD! TODD!
Oh, you know what it is? Scrape the "Made in China" sticker off your camera. What's it say underneath?
I wasn't born with the gene that says, "Stop eatin' prosciutto."
Huh!...I bet he won his fights, though! I bet he did! Here, have more Chablis.
Whoops--oh, crap.  Accidentally sent that to Roane Shaughnessy at Channel 7 News...damn auto-complete!
This is him! This is my guy! That's why he's my guy!
Huh, that's weird!  I've always heard that the chicks in Cozumel are pretty conservative this time of year!
You mean, like, as a gay dude, and also his dad, you could see that he was gay even as a little kid?
In fact, it's kinda beneath me.  I plan on forgettin' all this stuff within a week, hopefully two.  I got a hypno-session comin' up.
[[on phone]] You said WHAT to Molly?
I can do anything I need with the computer, and you'd be wise to admit that to yourself!
Hi, mom!  How you doin'?  You doin' OK?
Heh heh! You don't like it when I talk about my bonin', do you?
Uh huh. And this represents the actual dog phallus, not just the dog's oat tote?
You know what? I'M in the music biz. I got a tight chest. I look like I don't care if I spend six hundred dollars. Who needs Simon Le Cowell?!
Apparently they send you one every time your record goes platinum!
That's why when you go to play THESE days, they give you some insurance policy-friendly rubber putter with no damn feel. Drives me mad.
You know who I don't care about? Carol Burnett. Just can't. Just don't.
Anyhow, the lawyer looks at him pretty mean, because in their religion it's, like, super rude to be nosy.
Look at you, all dressin' the fool! What's gotten into you, Little Nephew?
Dirty hands? Kits? Clubfoot? What?
A secret, huh?  Well, that's real sweet of you.  Yeah, we'll make sure he gets it.  Who can we say it's from?
He wants to write my biography? Why, 'cause he's broke and I'm loaded?
It has a fully articulated syrup nozzle.
Congradulations, Cornelius. You are the baddest dude in town; you are the mirror that shows a normal man that he is a clown.
My AIBOs! I don't go nowhere without my little honeys!
I'm the rich guy!
So check it out, dude. I was in Whole Foods, you know, 'cause I had to get this special homeopathic foot powder-
Could be, doesn't have to be.  A dude walks down a street and a plane lands on his head; he never did what mattered.  Just sayin'.
No, Really! They are really silly people! Stop listening to them!
Uh huh, exactly. Plus maybe a small bowl of pears in syrup.
Heh heh!
Picture a perfect Swiss man sitting in his cubic black leather armchair, the crisp click of his lighter as he flames an unforgivingly precise jay--
I was gonna walk home from Mexico, but after a few miles I decided not to, and then I lost my wallet in a damn stream! How you like them shakes?
Lay off me, Beef! I got a headache the size of a 747 peeling out on my brain!
There's no spaghetti.
One of the first stars to appear in a "Lascivio-Scopic" picture show!
...present your Chain of Behavior card at any course, though, and you can use a real putter.
Listen, would you do me a big favor and put it around your neck for safekeeping?
I got to imitate Jack White, dude!
Yeah, Beef. These animals are killed in bizarre hunting betrayals because they were nerds. Will you just taste the beer?
Uh, if you could just print our Fiesta Names on the reciept, I'd appreciate that, Jai. We can look at them in the car.
How'd...how did you know you were related?
I got issues, man. I'm hella pullin' a psychology here.
Keillor... Keillor... that farm guy, right?  Here we go...
Yeah, that sounds about right.
NOW!
Lyle just picked up the new Candy Canyons DVD, dogg! Pull up a seat!
Don't ask me stuff, man! You just had a baby! Be cool!
Oh my god this is so hard
Man, I dig this font thing! I'm going to make myself a logo!
I worry about you!
Well, the main thing was that i got this recurrin' voice mail, a breathy Latina's voice sayin' "We must meet, for i am your true love." Finally she left an address, some apartment way over in Brunina De Nada, this isolated farm community that is like fifty miles past nowhere
Can he...DUDE! Of course he can pay!
Well, it's actually kind of a hassle to own.
No, I ain't got a fax machine!  I also ain't got an Apple IIc, polio, or a falcon!
(Thinking) Fine, let the guy be Founder of Williams-Sonoma. It ain't worth arguin' about.
My best friend's gettin' married, and
That thing you said about the Elephant Man really made his day.
Heh! There was even this one movie where James Bond went to the moon and got his Sperm on!
There now, just pluck away at the banjo.
It's a thing, man!
Heh!  Yeahhhhh.  Just got it back from the printer.
What'sâ¦pimp skitters?
We...uh...we sell special cards for...for kids who had to get operations on Christmas!
Pat! What I tell you! Crashes! Wrecks! A child's pink Converse on the pavement...Is there a foot inside? The police walk up the mother's driveway! I'm serious!
Oh! Teodor! Thanks for bein' the bigger man and gettin' in touch!
I don't know!  My brain just told me I was done!  Gimme another thing to draw.
There we go!  Got 'im!
Chris just don't want to write no damn new strip today, he says!
Alright, now say it again, dammit! LOUDER!
Malloreddus?
See, that's where you got me all wrong.  Listen, Leon--
It's true, Beef! Guys like Bach used to do stuff like this!
Now don't you say a word. I have made the decision to sacrifice one of my little guys and that's final.
"ChatSacks," as I'm calling them, will come in a dual-ball base model.
How's it going with YOU, Mr. Hurlin' in the Bathroom?
I'll put ten in him! Ten rounds, maybe!
Oh! Ha ha!  An amount of carrot in my ear!
Yeah, man! The fruit salad was hella raunchy! That fruit was ooooold. But that Captain's salami tray was tight, yo. You plump for the roast pork loin, dogg? Oh, proclaim on that pork loin!
Dude, I put my extra cheese and nasty hard tortillas in an area. They get all rotty. A fly has a baby. Dirt is born.
Alright, run with it. Use your imagination, just start building. I gotta makes a tennis date at the club, but I'll be back later.
You know, Ben would have the ball, but he'd be passing it to Matt... both totally smiling...
Bring her over, man! Everybody likes to come to Ray's house and go swimming and grill it all up!
Naw, Man! I don't use no chumpy Yahoo personals. Talk about your people who eat nachos at every meal!
Yes... I believe I will start with the ConsommÃ© a la BohÃ©mienne.
Eventually, though, Bird's luck ran out.  Aloisius and the interpreter realized they didn't need him, and started their own gig.
See what you did there?  You went negative.  Negative don't sell.
Dang, this place looks fancy!
You know, Roast Beef, you might actually be this good at something yourself!
But Pat, The Cure is silly! It is silly to like The Cure!
Jesus Christ, Beef.  I try to invent a happiness holiday and you got dads layin' in creeks blowin' themselves away on Christmas.
Okay, alright. Keep goin'.
Man, that is way smart of an analogy.  Kings were clever as HELL.
We can take a lung from one of my AIBOs and give it to Beef!
I don't want some nobody in a CGI wheelchair. That ain't got juice, that's just a waste of money.
Yeah, all with the date and time stamp still showin' 'cause she couldn't figure out how to work her Nikon!
So!  You think you ever gonna want kids, Beef?
ain't gonna wake up
Oh, that's right! I put 2,000 Flushes in the toilet last night! I can't wait to see the great blue color that it made!
We gotta find us a Underground and grab us some Subway!
Daaamn! Look who's bein' a dick about terms!
Pretty much.  I mean, I've had Snapple, and plus that stuff at Chinese joints, so maybe I'm, like, "intermediate."
Yeah, I'd like Meal #2 with a Sprite.
How much Christian Brothers we got left in that bottle?
I think I got that one!
See, Lonis, the way you doin' it's all wrong.  With a product like yours, it's all about the marketing.
...but you're leaving the company.
She was all just whinin' and carryin' on for so many days I wanted to get on a plane and cold flyer her ass outta there myself!
I...I had to look a lotta stuff up for my advice column!
... and market us some Home Depot brand ... say ...
You...you knew I would fugue if I heard you were down? Dang, Beef! But what about Fauntleroy Brown?
Dude, let me hit that with a little of this new Doctor Lunatic "Assisted Suicide" habanero sauce I just got!
It ain't like I'm gonna put a black-light over her seat and announce that the digestif is a Jager shooter from between her tits!
German shepherds, man. German shepherds named Sierra. I got six, plus three kayaks and a porta-kiln.
You guys wait here, I'll need about fifteen minutes. Don't worry if you hear coughin' and laughin'.
But look, dude!  LOOK!
Ultra-realistic mannequins. My portfolio. I'm thinkin' of investin' in this company, so they sent me some samples.
It means that kids will always play these records, man! Hip hop is the streets!
AWWW yeah! Who wants to go to high school... IN MY PANTS!
I lost my copy of Braveheart, so I'm seein' if Steve's Party does anything for me.
ROAR!
Wait, hold on.  He knows for sure the exact day and time he's gonna die?
Lyle! Welcome back, man! How was Scotland?
Little nephew! What are you doing here?
Ain't nobody wants somethin' they givin' away for free! -- You never hear the terrible tale of Strawberry, the neighborhood 'ho?
Happy Birthday, Beef!
Naw, man. You can get knockoff Tiffany from any Senegalese for a thin ten. You always see sluts wearin' that heart necklace at bad grocery stores, all with their fake Vuitton bag and two babies.
Dolly to the dollhouse. The mole has left the mountain. There are seven pieces of rice. Oh me oh my. Do you copy.
[[holds hands up to face, aghast]] >
"It looks like I'm bragging." Huh. Thanks, T. Say, are you all split on green? Is this some kind of low shenanigan?
Dude!
Hell yes I can still sport wood!
Dang, Beef! This ain't no regular hangover! This is the big one!
Who the hell is Milklin?
Bloatee? What?
Oooh.  Hold on, is my tummy.
I'm knockin' off a little early today.  How's your stuff comin'?
Hell yes I do.  I googled all kinds of stuff up on eBay.  Check it.
...AKKOLADE is havin' his mouth wide open at all times, and usin' a fake Monty Python picture-jaw to lip-synch with...
He would have an interpreter sign it to him.  The whole performance was something of a terrible, crippled miracle.  Meanwhile, Rustmouth sank deeper into obscurity.
THANK! YOU! PHILIPPE! THIS! IS A GREAT! DAY! FOR AMERICA!
I...I don't like this, Beef!  I gotta get outta here!  What if I fugue?  I'm not cool with this, man!  I didn't think it'd be like this!  Help me out, Beef!  Help me, man! Help! HELP!
'Course, they never show James Bond actually mackin'. He's way too classy for that.
Connie! No, man! We got mad cash money to make! We signed that contract with Williams-Sonoma!
Careful, dogg. That drink's delicious, but it ain't permanent. Here, take mine while I mix up another.
Damn, that was some potent stuff! I am LUCID!
You found what, Teodor?
We had all kinds of raps that we were pretty sure we could sell to the big names...
I have Airwolf.  This is not code language.  I am flying Airwolf because I own Airwolf.
Whoah! No last names, friend!
That thing where you shock him with the two paddles?
On the linoleum in the kitchen, like Eddie Van Halen! On the kitchen counter, like David Lee Roth! On a ski boat parked on white carpet in a garage in Arizona, like Sammy Hagar! We gonna do this up Rock and Roll Smithsonian!
(On the phone) I'm mixin' 7 & 7's, dude! You want one too, right?
Whoah! Who are you?
Alright Beef, now open your eyes!
Damn straight! I got like 50cl of bad tequila here, a paper cup, and some powdered Tang or whatever, and this is how you treat a guest? Man, I know you know better than this, dogg. You know how to set up a basic decency bar. You're just tryin' to piss me off. You got a game plan,  here.
Oh no way! Simon's gonna be in town! I ain't seen that dude in ages! When's he get here?
We should set up a time to go camping.
Sorry Kev. Yo, you try any of the club eggnog? Man, that action was a coma with nutmeg on top. I pour one out for the stick of butter that gave its life to be that eggnog.
Make it a hundo, and go heavy on the foreplay. I actually do like that stuff, and I felt like you rushed the last one.
Next Services 30 Miles, dude. I'm starvin'.
I'ma be Abraham LINCOLN!
I really wanted to eat these!
Damn.  I didn't mean to step on Teodor's fancy new guitar, but I did.  I should give him about six hundred dollars.
I give you...the ChatSack Triple-Play.
Come on Lazarus, let's go catch up with CNN Financial and get us a little dinner!
I wouldn't let a damn MOLECULE of my dick touch you!
Téodor?  Naw, baby -- he's out cold.  What's in the box?
Like crazy people! Strap a wireless "cell phone headset" to their ear, put 'em in a pressed shirt, and suddenly they're just "taxpayers on the go"!
Dogg, you are exactly right.
We talkin' 'bout red glass Venetian candles? Push-button cigarette machine in the entry?
Seriously, Beef -  you think this beard can conceal the Voice Donut?
How's my new sign coming, Phillippe?
Watch it little man because you're on thin ice!
MOMMMM!  ROAST BEEF WANTS TO KISS GIRLS ON THE TITTIES!
Just make it up, dude!
Yeah, west coast all the way. You know a guy?
Uh-huh. Right.
Are... are ALL my dudes breast men?
There's Sweetie, and Pumpernickel, and Magic, and Sam, and Melon, and Olive, and Ruby, and Tammy, and Mr. Sours, and Bite-Bite, and Joe, and Okey-Doke, and Fingers, and Sweet Spot, and Slow-lane, and Weldon, and Doctor Kisses-
...no, that's a lot tacky. Belt not matchin' shoes, now that's a LITTLE... no, that's real tacky as well. Movin' your fork between hands just to take a bite... no... unbearable...
Hey man. My nephew wants you to come talk dirty at his birthday party. Can you dig it?
Yeah, me too. Couple tacos
THE GREAT LORD SATAN SHALL... Shall administer...
Lyle, you communicate maunly through smells and peeing, yet you couldn't get along with the dog.
That's real neat, Beef. But tell me -- when you comin' home? Things just ain't the same!
Hello, CafePress? I need to have a shirt made. I want it to be white and say certain information about George Clooney--
Hey TÃ©odor! You got the juice to make me a baseball card?
But he does want to thank AmINakedOrNot.com for being yesterday's top referrer!
Man, you ran my whole show. You just wound me up and set me down, B.
Each of these ingredients I would eat on their own. Don't egghead in the ghetto.
It's weird, you know. It's like, at any minute they might stop and go, "just kidding!" and go get some chicks.
Really? He did? Tell me more, mom.
You lookin' damn fine, ladies!
Go ahead, Todd. Try.
[[thinking]] Damn.  After that Magreaux dog stunt of his, I ain't so sure I feel too bad about this.
When you said gazelle just now, my first thought was of grilled kebabs over jicama-sesame slaw with peanut-ancho coulis. I'm not kidding.
Interestingly, no.  At this level, the market demands non-linear value.  We go down to a single ball.
Sorry Kev. Oh! Oh! That bubble-butt bartender! Talk about dumb! Heh--hey, don't get me wrong, I looooove dumb, but that was like "stick two  wires in her and she can power a clock" dumb. I mean, you ever seen a bartender thinks Heineken is wine?!
Man, YOU know I can't remember where Survivor takes place one season to the next!
We gonna be lung brothers, Beef! Just hang in there!
Say, they got a real nice underground over there in Mojave! Let's check it out!
Yeah. We even set up a special area where he can go and do his last things.
No worries, I'll cover it. Cheaper in the long run, you know, or something to that effect.
One time in Sunday school I pronounced "Nigeria" as "Niggeria." Diplomacy's a tough tattie.
Leo always was wound pretty tight. You should've seen how ballistic he went when someone took his Beach Boys CD last week. I didn't have the balls to tell him it was me, so I snuck it back into his Caddy that day you met him.
Yeah, dogg! It was *hella fun!*
I'm just seein' if I'm some kind of math genius savant, you know.
Dice are...from Arabia! They symbolize math! Wait, no...they...they modify an existing game! I...DAMN. Man, I can almost taste it...
Heh! Yeah, it IS kind of like there's a party around your neck, and everyone within reason is invited!
Hmm... tomorrow... what's on my plate tomorrow...
Yo check it out, Beef! Let's see who can jump over that log the best!
You guys are probably gonna need to urinate soon! Hop in!
Nothing is more old-school than baking your own damn staff of life!
You... are... rad!
I'm a MoÃ«t Bellini all chilled up real nice,
How's a precious tomato plant supposed to thrive in this hated-at dirt, Pat?!
[[to himself]] He said that it had been rendered so insensitive by the procedure that I constantly sought sex in some vain hope of reawakening genital feeling. I am not sure that I want to help out a dude who insulted the very lifeline of my heritage.
I'm buggin' cause my best friend is gettin' married, ain't I? I'm actin' like the fucker belongs to me.
I... wow. T, I don't want to lose this contest. It should be you in the elephant costume, not me. Cool?
Hmmm.  How much you gettin' for a piano these days, anyway?
Thank... Thank you for calling MoviePhone. Today's movies are pretty good. You got Spiderman to choose from or also Titanic at 7:30.
But wait, what if it's some new MC sendin' in a demo? Gravity Train sounds like it has the legs to be the most important new dance song of the year...hate to get scooped...
Hold on, man.  They're about to do a hilarious bit where they compare their junk to dog food.
The capital of Quebec is Queblowme.  Next question.
Well, Téodor, as I'm sure you remember the Todd account has fallen through.
Serious, T, genius call hirin' on all those molly brothers.  Pay 'em out "fivepence-none-the-shilling" or whatever and keep the change, is what I...what, dude?
Huh? Who? What? I'm in the tub, dude. I got mad suds popping all around me.
Well, Roast Beef!  I guess now that you got the Internet in your brain it will be real easy to take out a Personals ad!
Sorry mom! You okay after your trip? You need anything? Rib-eye? Mimosa?
Get outta here! Man, you been readin' too much internet, Lyle!
Look, Philippe! You knew you were gonna have to pay for this software sometime!
Why does this...
Everything we invent, Chinese dudes did it like 900 years before.
Beef!  Beef!  Are you okay?
All those aviator glasses, watchin' anime rabbits!
Kind of like the Kool Aid Man, you know? Only, instead of delighting a room full of thirsty kids, he has a gun and he's extremely angry at two naked men.
Nah, I ain't wanna eat anything that was a coprophiliac. We been through this. What other kind of turkeys you got?
Fine, then! I already SEEN Sex Limo! I was just doin' you a favor!
You want an olive, or you want a twist? Olive, or twist? This is Ketel One, boy! You know what that IS, don't you? DON'T YOU?
Alright, you gitch'yself on up to your room and finish your homework.
So he just needs a lung transplant, right? I'll give him one of mine! Let's get movin'!
Dear. God. I. Am. Not. A. Religious. Man. But. Please. Help. Me. See. The. Connection. Here.
(Thinking) Just startin'. Not right, but close.
It's REALLY hard!  But when you've been coughing your brains out for three weeks, I guess you finally rearrange your priorities and drop the dose.
Roast Beef! That lady don't have no underpants on!
[thinking] Where's my...DAMN!  I forgot my room key!
That flashy son of a bitch!
Yeah, but from then on he knew he wasn't the bluest cat around. He kept performing, but in his heart he knew he didn't have it the hardest.
I don't care if he's old and fat and dumb and makes bad decisions about being high on cocaine, the man has contributed something to this world
Ray Smuckles, the new student transfer from Metropolitan Sex College 9, drove his Pierce-Arrow right up to the Hardy Boys and tooted his horn!
Now would be a good time to decide, though.  Can you hang with money, or do you go back to the way you were?
Dammit! Don't say cocaine ideas near this kid! It's his BIRTHDAY, fool!
For FREE?!
What are you talkin' about, Beef?
Damn.  Wow.  If you put Sodium Pentothal under Beef's eyelids and electrocuted him pretty hard, he'd ask for exactly that.
We were like "WHAT say WHAT?! Hold on, nigga!"
Bensington Butters!
(thinks) Oh man no no he ain't got to do this twice in one night.
Five grand, dude! Don't consider not doing this!
Those guys are friends, man. Those guys are straight-up friends.
Thanks, Chaka.
Help us out, Beef.  We got a situation that is much at hand.
Pregnant F
Y-Yeah...we got a little!
Well, when I was in my younger days, I made a lot of videos that I'm not too proud of.
Naw, man.  I been in here in a while
Your fans be all worried 'bout their D&D trades!
Heh! Sounds like you been doin' some serious dreamin' under that anesthetic.
Dude.  No one should go to the Transfer Station.
Recumbent Tai-Chi, huh. I got a special move I want to discuss with you.
American Curl, kinda light brown, Versace glasses . . . Yeah! Yeah! That's me!
Damn.  He's probably on his way to get her outta there right now.  Total Lloyd Dobler-style, all holding his wireless laptop over his head,
Never almost have diabetes, dude.  It ain't no way to live.
What in hell are you talkin' about?! didn't you see this hat?
I-this ain't that, dude! I am mad about what I SAID I am mad about! Packages!
Comin' up with new sandwich concepts and stuff? Talk to me, doggie! You know, I had this one idea about a way of bakin' the roll so it has a curly little tailâ
Hey, who left this nice tasseled loafer out here in the yard?!
A case of Red Stripe?
Whoah! Hey, fellows!
Hey Marmaduke! Did you dig a hole today? Huh? Did you eat someone else's food? Did you behave in a disobedient fashion?
I am getting into the bed because that is what Jack White does
That's the exact car from Knight Rider, dude! KITT!
Well, it's been scientifically proven that the meat of an animal that dies without suffering tastes better. Modified-death animals are executed in a loving, cage-free environment.
Bless the baby angel who is in charge of days like today.
Sheesh.  How many "Tony, Toni, TonÃ©" songs can a dude listen to.
That's all the latest with tostadas.
Pat saw the gay pics of himself and that gave him hella pause!
Hi! I simply looove reading about your family in the newspaper every day!
Bad news, TÃ©odor. Major setback with the Todd account.
Man, the adult film industry is really gettin' rocked by all these HIV outbreaks.
Here--let's try somethin'.
Come on guys--- Fanciest Dinner In The World! My treat! I'm serious!
Oh no, Weldon is stayin' with you. I got all his favorite toys and stuff right here, plus instructions. I gotta run. Bye. I gotta go. Call me.
Aww c'mon now Roast Beef!  You a pretty damn handsome fellow!
You a charming fellow!  You doin' the ladies a big disservice just by hangin' out with ol' Ray tonight!
I have a guy in Sierra Leone. Let me know.
I ain't sure I'd even want to wake up again if my ass cheek and brain were that stabbed, you guys catch my drift?
Damn. Like only one cup of milk left in this bad boy, and I need to make room on the door for the new bloody mary mix.
Textbook Lavender.
Daaamn! A proper winner's feast! You think he'll close the place just for us?
Daaamn, no operating costs! I like your model!
Phew, glad THAT'S over! Man, 1882 was MEGA dull!
Okay then.  Let's run some tests.  We got to see what the optimal weight to hang off the front of the body is.
We gonna marry the HELL outta that woman!
I...AM...RAY!
Huh. Good point.
Damn. Nice, Beef.
Doc! Doc!  I think he's wakin' up!  His hands are movin'!
Now I gently push you back against the pillows.
Yeah, I get that at least once in this world someone had some delight for once. I know that ain't a common thing. But on my couch, dude. Couldn't someone have had some delight into an old refried beans can?
Yeah, but I know it's around now and I got this gift burnin' a hole in my pocket.
It's gonna touch if I move!
Nipple rings can be sophisticated. Think Sean Connery.
T-Teodor, How'd you get past the gate?!
It only goes up from there! A dude with just ONE mp3 of his butt on the Internet makes eight to ten times that much!
Sorry, man!  That chochicha had some hangin' naturals!
Heh heh! Daaaamn, I got it! Do it straight-up Carlin! Ain't go sappy...bring the house down!
"Tim and Carl's Houseboat Party."
"See, Lyle, all his life Rustmouth was the quintessential bluesman. Absolutely everything he did was touched by bad luck. He was blessed by that bad luck, in a way. But then along came Silent Bird Wallace and suddenly Rustmouth wasn't the unluckiest man alive any more. Just his luck."
I'll call in a few days about those Fiesta Names, okay?
Weird. Is he ... arresting me?
All right. But I ain't got a lotta firepower.
Yo. My name's Carlo... Fertezzi. I got the goods. NOW.
Frank steadied his younger blonder brother Joe.
Oh! Our "cards for guys" idea from yesterday! Man, did this throw me.
Hold on, wait. I got to do this right.
We just finished your makeover! You can't quit now!
Speed up!
Whoah!
Anyhow, before I can leave, this cute clerk chick comes up to ask if I need help...
Here, let's take a look.
A clown is incredibly hot, fool!
I was just, like, channeling, you know?  It's like, what if this was Einstein's last equation that he never got to write down before he died?
Well, we got kind of an El Bulli think goin' on here. I call it "cold nachos"
Here, man.  I'm sorry about all that.  We cool?
Are there any women named Derek I wonder

Pat! Pat You gotta be careful in that boat! It ain't finished!
There will be room for all my babies, right?
Sipes...Sipes...sounds kinda familiar.
I was like, BONE... BONE... BONE...
Oh. Dude. You got to check this out. Close the curtains.
(Typing) Sandy (female) opened the door. She held a delicate crystal Bellini coupe ($29). A man cut trees across the street. He would do, for now. She grabbed her tits.
Okay >
Hey BEEF! Wake up! How do you know when salmon's done all the way through?
Try to buy fake nuts for your phone.
Man you find a car that runs on "bio-filtered" Ravenswood zinfandel comin' directly outta my catheter, and then we are having this conversation. Zero-emissions car, zero-emissions man. Think big.
[[contemplating, rubbing his paw against his chin as he looks at a Nightlife]] Interesting.
It's called the Isosceles Lock.
You are rad!
Sony sent him to me!
Classic Cavendish, all the way!
It's a stone blow, man. This shit is Druid. This shit is Easter Island. This shit is Druid people at Easter Island, man.
Man, listen to how nice all his guitar notes are.
Hey! Do any of you kids have curiosity about... space?! [[A child is raising his hand]]
Call your guy, George, and hand me the phone. We gonna get this done.
Who pulled the string on this clichÃ©d hip hop minion?
Eventually, though, Bird's luck ran out.  Aloisius and the interpreter realized they didn't need him, and started their own gig.
You think they just let any old deranged freak with plastic bag shoes use the phone at Western Union?!
Yeah, in the third grade, maybe! And you shouldn't even be usin' language like this at your age!
Serious, though, man. You ever go creamy in the noggin, I got your back til end of days. Trust on that.
Why you think they make that helicopter in Iowa what recites People Magazine at 500 feet?
Dude, don't act like you don't know that Airwolf is faster than any jet.  Hold on while I drop the rope ladder.
The hypnotist is gonna get it back down so I can just check email and maybe get stuff onto my ipod three times outta ten tries.
Yo Connie, come on down for the Roast Beef bachelor party!  It's gonna be off the-
The Hindenburg of walkin' into a room sees ME  screwin' this up?! Stay home, dude. I'll brief you later.
Ouch is right, only the dog never got a chance to say that.  Come over and have some Brie cheese, man.
Way easy. You just play a round at your local without dumpin' a Slurpee down the ramp in front of the windmill, or squeezin' a hoochie mama's box through her pants while near a family, and you're in.
What'd I tell you guys! My mom's the best!
Let's have a contest to see who hates Paris Hilton the most!
Is this a ... "Friends' Arrest"?
Man, this ain't right, Beef. I been thinkin'.
We just tell his species to the on-board computer and Airwolf uses its on-board spectra-sonic rays to locate objects with his specific density and size.
Exactly. So, like, hair is retro... childish, in a way. Havin' hair at our age is like wearin' three Swatches and poppin' a boner at your grandma's house.
Still, man, you can't hack a massive furious Nazi from San Bernadino. You got to raise your fists!
...only she smells it too, and does that thing where she pretends she just remembered something and turns around on one foot while biting her lip and snapping her fingers.
Ha ha!
Teodor, man! We need a logo for our new joint company!  Come help us out, doggie!
Todd's van?
Ouch.
Man, don't ask me that. I ain't even sat down. You got any grenadine?
Teodor ... would want it ... this waaaay.
That is Spongebob's house
Say hey, D'Shawn! 'sup 'sup?
Yeah...being an English celebrity is kind of like being an Italian car: you can go about eighty miles in any one direction before everybody stops caring who you are and just gets mad at you for smoking.
Seriously, man.  Have fun having sex.
Alright Beef, let's scam this guy back into the stone age.  Start hackin', I'ma get some Stellas.
Or, like, Rambo might bust through the apartment wall and yell, "CUT IT OUT!"
So what does a human baby look like right when it first comes out? Spill it, O!
Roast Beef!  Get up here!  Check out this!
I wonder how you ride this thing.
[[Soon.]] What's the deal with these Jeeps, anyway? I don't remember ever hearin' 'bout no Jeeps in the Fight.
Hey Marmaduke! On your website it says that you can only get it on for like ten seconds, and if it isn't totally silent you lose your wood!
Oh, it don't stop there! Not with Catfish!
Huh?! Man, this is totally outta left field! I'm goin', "What?"
Yeah, west coast all the way. You know a guy? Oh, get out! He used to butler for James Brown? How come he quit?
Sheesh! This is long! Mind if I sign it now and read it later?
Alright!  Choice is yours.  Totally asleep alive kid, or fontina omelettes with a hundred dollar bill put next to the plate at a forty-five degree angle.
Seriously!  You ever picture a little one on your knee, same face as you?
Well, it ain't good, if you're okay with hearin' that.
Awwww! Now ain't he sweet!
[[takes a drink of his martini]] >
Now I just got to toggle through some commands here...man, this interface is terrible! I feel like I'm tryin' to set the time on a cheap oven!
YOU JUST STAY THE *FUCK* OUT OF EVERYBODY'S FACE UNTIL YOU GOT THE FUCKIN' JUICE TO GET A JOB WHERE THEY GIVE YOU A *CHAIR*!
The audience, man. Sentence by sentence, as we type it. The girls all hootin' and hollerin', cheerin' the good lines and booin' the bad.
Aww baloney! Here, let me see that!
What if someone finds it?!  They could test for my DNA!
Check out this statistic! It says here a guy with only SIX pictures of his butt on the Internet makes more per year than a public schoolteacher!
Heh! Thanks! You think so?
(thinking) ...which causes the subject to take out his wallet and throw it as far as he can from himself.
He's got a pen that's actually a time bomb!
You guys been packin' Hot Lunches in my elevator?!
Oh hell no. Those kids are growin' up in a different world than the one we came up in, you know?
I'll make Roast Beef a quick little fake one.  He'll get a laugh out of it and I can say I'm sorry.
I don't! I just didn't understand the eBay description!
SHIT!
I'm mixin' 7 & 7's, dude! You want one too, right?
You know, people always say that.
[[singing]] Where is Ray
Way way wait...Cody Travis, that country dode who sells CDs' to Kmart people?
They let athletes wear leg warmers!
So long, soldier.
Roast Beef! Wait! Nooo!
So...so what's the main thing I got to know goin' into this?
They got this website "CafePress" makes it easy to put your notions on a  shirt.
Look at all these funny letters I can write my name in!
"I hate myself for only liking hot crusty steaks! I am dumb!"
But I'm French! French dudes can get away with that stuff! It shouldn't be a problem!
Beef, you gotta help me!
Here then, smart guy! YOU figure it out!
Yeah, man. He pocket-dialed me. I was still nervous, though.
I've seen bigger! My cousin knew this girl in Canada who had J-cups!
Crap, dude! He's comin'! Run! Just grab one and RUN!
Alright, Leander! You're tall! Come help me out.
First grade was a blur.  I hate people from New York.  I would be nice to Tom Cruise if he was nice to me.  I could personally invent something on the order of a hand cranked apple-peeling maching, but not much more complex than that.  I'll admit this.
Eventually, though, Bird's luck ran out. Aloisius and the interpreter realized they didn't need him, and started their own gig.
I'm skippin' a day.  You go on and do whatever you want.
Look, Todd...I don't usually do this, but...I've got a sexy video you can watch.  How about that?
Finally. Anything special I should know about this guy?
Oh, uh...I'm Ray, by the way.
I personally started by reading a few sections in this really old Amy Vanderbilt etiquette book that I found sealed in a plastic bag in the toilet tank.
I...exactly, T! EXACTLY!
Damn, Pat!  What's up, my gay homey!  Mojito of artisanal rum?
Who's more legit? The cursed man, or the man who's cursed by the cursed man? Two souls chasin' each other down the same drain, dude. Anyhow, let's talk royalty structures.
Thank you for calling Telemarketers Anonymous!
How's the campaign coming, m'blokes?
Well look at that!  It's half-past Chablis o'thirty!
Troy Harlem? What? T, you a secret gay porno actor? Damn, this is handy!
So stand on it, Agnes!
Good. it's the only honorable thing I can do. What?
I got this theory that all gay dudes secretly want practical four-door sedans.  This is my way of sayin' to Pat, "Hey, man.  We ain't need no frontin' around here.  Just be you."
Daaamn, nice work with that inheritance angle! Pat's probably runnin' over here so fast that he can't close his mouth and his cheeks are balloonin' out with wind!
I'll have my people manage that.  Maybe set some aside for a rainy day?
Why, I bet you're this good at computer programmin'! Better, even!
Hey Teodor!  It's Ray!  Look, doggie, we gonna be home in a little while but we gotta get us some Subway first!  Can you look on the Internet for--
Yo Cornelius!  What's a good tea to like?
Do you want to smoke...
My mom says I gotta come out here and apologize to you.
Catullus was the first poet who ever got his Bone on, little man!
The *RUDEST!*
Now I'm actually wonderin' if I even LIKE kings, man.  I'll see you later, I got to take stock.
What? No, man! That's the real deal! That's his actual head in there!
How bad did they do him. Talk to me.
"OYO." I see that one a lot. What's he even tryin' to get across?
My fight-or-flight was racin' but it could put together NO conclusion about what was happenin' here.
Yeah, I got a favor.
All cats know how to use the damn toilet.
Me and this phone go way back, Beef!  You know that!  Now what were you ---
Huh!  You know, that's a neat way to frame a challenge.  I'm 'a do somethin' like that...
You better not be about to tell me to go watch the damn news.
We gonna get omelettes, Jimi. Hot omelettes in the PM. You just rest.
People hella wig on ahi, but to me it just don't taste like much. Emperor has no clothes.
Roast Beef, me and the fellows chipped in and got you a little something for your birthday.
That's right, Beef! And after we have some drinks we all goin' out for pepperoni pizza!
Dang. Weird. Maybe I better play and you sing for a bit.
Okay, shoot, man, shoot!
Excuse me, Todd?
These pancakes look delicious!  Thank you!  Ooh, and a tasty Bloody Mary.. what a treat!
A wise man once said, "never show a fool half a job." I'll let you know what I did AFTER I'm done runnin' America. Not that you'll need to ask.
If you get caught with no receipt, and you ain't in the shop, there's nothing they can do!
(thinking) Do I do the humanitarian thing and bow out so he can prosper?
Hey now, everybody! Tonight is a very special night for us goths!
Good news, Beef! You just landed a paid speaking gig as Jaime the Science Friend!
Sheesh, ain't there anything them Chinese DON'T consider a delicacy? Look at this guy on public TV eatin' raw snake cheeks.
Philippe!  Come quick!  Roast Beef is havin' a baby!
You... you know I do, man! Stop it! Why you got to make this worse for all of us?
TODD?! What the damn hell you doin' callin' me on the telephone! You in rehab! You can't use no damn phone! What if you order crack?
Look, Todd...I don't usually do this, but... I've got a sexy video you can watch. How about that?
...I shouldn't have yelled at him. That was uncalled for.
Whoah, where is everybody? What the hell?!
So how's your Subway doin', Vlad? What's new in the custom sandwich game?
We gotta hold this pose, man.  Norman Rockwell's gettin' his easel outta the car.
T?odor? No, ain't seen him lately. We kinda need a little distance right now.
Huh!
Beef! What in the hell?!
Okay, if you could be in the Guinness Book of World Records for one thing, what would it be?
Oh shit, doggie! Let me throw on my duds and grab some bottled Cokes!
I know that! Don't act like I don't know that! You think I just fell off the not knowin' you boat yesterday?
Sheesh. Remember just watchin' Mr. Wizard?  I never gave diabetes a thought back then.  But now, man.  But now.
Huh?
And for the fish course, the Turbot a la Meuniere
I turned a poorly thought-out phone call into a great idea: organic bio-copters that soothe ultra-local micro-crops with a "dusting" touch of pleasant topics! Imagine how much people will pay for potatoes that are as "socially aware" as they are!"
I have Airwolf.  I'm just seein' if there's anything I can do to help my guys.
Hey, T.  All the brothers in the syndicate just chose what's gonna be they new 'thang for the year.
Alright, let's hit this joint.
People want to eat some fuckin' dinner and have some fuckin' money! What the FUCK do you think gettin' up in the morning is all about? Asshole.
Whoah, when did they get a motorcycle?
You know that lesbians are funnier than usual people, right? I got a theory on that.
What do you mean, they put up a sign? What's it say?
Do it when his eyes are closed? Where's the honour in that?
Oh, good! My new banjo got here!
It would be like if the Queen woke you up every morning. Too Special.
Oh, that? I got it off eBay. It's like an auction-type deal that you do on the computer.
(into phone) Bob?  Sorry about that.  Friend of mine.  Good guy.
A... a little bit, yeah.  This stuff's only what, about 50 proof?
Aight, doggy D. I got us a sample page from the Williams-Sonoma catalog. Think you can whip up some hot-ass love fiction around this junk?
Just put your arm around it and call it Timmy.
Ah-ha, I see. But no trace of vandalism?
YOUUUUU!
"Try using unlburicated condoms as condiment dispensures at your next backyard barbecue!"
Baby, Martha Stewart is comin' over to cook us this ugly-ass fish!
Daaamn, nut job! We outta moonshine! Why you only bring one jar?!
"If a number can't come real
Whatchu' drinkin' there, Cornelius!  You know I get my Sad on when folks bring they own bev!
No, I ain't got a fax machine!  I also ain't got an Apple ][c, polio, or a falcon!
Yeah, yeah.  Great.  When we leavin'?
Man, I've had it with old people sayin' "our morals gettin' worse with every generation" and "why can't it be like the good old days."
Whoah! No thanks!
Yeah, Beef! I DID commission you and Molly a custom romance novel for Christmas! It finally showed up?
How come nobody's comin' over here?
Your fifteen minutes are up and it's time for the broom!
Oh, you mean Rutherford?
Man, the food photography in this Home Depot catalog is ass!
I'll give you a hint: you should not be proud of your career!
It is an art, isn't it!
Dang, Emeril and Spongebath live in the same building as Tina!
Ahem..."We unanimously found Jaime the Science Friend to be the perfect entertainment choice for our group: a side-splitting send-up which glorifies White pride and Christian values." What?
Roast Beef, did yyyou steal my laundry?
I'm talkin' about your choice of setting.
MUCH style! >
Oh, hey JM! Listen, I wanted to talk to you about that photo you took of me on the can.
... and inside? You guessed it! Steve's Party!
Yeah, and that was actual real music! You, you just yellin' to some beatbox, sayin' that algebra is gay!
Fuck you for being some hot dumbass employed by a cell phone company!  And fuck your calculated tight black pants!
Don't do a grody mouth!  I'm serious! I want everyone to be happy and cook hot dogs and hit! The hell you should flap your boys in my face!
Well, uh...you know how you feel when you see a lady?
Some women dig mystery, man. It's a thing.
Seriously, man!  Who writes this shit?  Nerdy bitches on speed?
[[singing]] In heaven
How do you even get to be king, anyway?
TÃ©odor is like
Dude, are you bangin' a website?
Oh, bag that.  You're the man!  You're the man in like seventy ways.
Do it when his eyes are closed? Where's the honor in that?
Well shit, man! Let's wrap that sucker up!  Where those Tofutti-Cuties at?
In 1975, scientists working at Harvard University created a man who had no chance of making it in this world. Hence, Roast Beef.
Exactly. I saw somethin' my brain didn't have a spot for and it was like gettin' bit on the stomach by a horse.
I'm not so sure you're the kind of -- Beef!  Wait!
LOOOOVE...
Nah, not if you got insight to the actual idiot mind. Check it!
An example?
[supine, wearing a suit made of newspapers]  Dick Dale's hands are so strong he could play the Golden Gate bridge like a harp
Man, these Gilmore Girls just talk too goddamned much.
Dude! Remember how I don't know German?
It... it tested very well with our focus group! I... I think you might want to reconsider that opinion!
Man, these Gilmore Girls just talk too goddamned much!
I just sold 34 million albums, Beef! We'll get another one!
Daaang! Uh...um...Oh! [[he reads aloud]] "Windows *again*, huh?!"
No, we all just think that the guy next to us is puritanical.  In secret, we ALL scopin' lo-fi porn on our iPhones and wishin' we had ever figured out how to make our cars do a wheelie.
Beef! BEEF! We...I never got to talk with my dad!
Yeah, hello? ...Wait, what? Every time a bell rings? I... an angel gets its wings, Philippe. Why you callin' me so late, kid?
Tell Carmela I had to take Christopher to the dentist! Later, Beef!
Hug the Fuck out of 'em Philippe!
Of course!
AIRWOLF! FIND...AN OTTER!
... and bang.  You just extended your lifestyle brand.
That's a damn Who song, foolish child!
Sit down and watch for a spell, Beef.
On the back of the couch. Unmistakable. About one foot up.
-Phillipe's new Vice President!
*It's like we care or something!*
Sorry Kev. Oh! Oh! That bubble-butt bartender! Talk about dumb! Heh--hey, don't get me wrong, I looooove dumb, but that was like "stick two  wires in her and she can power a clock" dumb. I mean, you ever seen a bartender thinks Heineken is fag?!
Ain't nothin' more special...than...lung...brothers...
So, Roast Beef, what are you gonna buy with your first million?
COME ON BABY! COME SEE WHO RAY IS!
Holy crap! Cornelius? Lyle? What are you guys doin' in here waitin' for video colonoscopies?
Si, si
What are you programming it to do?
Alright, Pat, if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it all the way.
Could I hear it through the door? They practically evacuated the building! You sounded like Chewbacca tryin' to lose weight for the prom!
We got to take shots of it!  Tell me how classic that is!  We got to be able to tell that story dude!
(thinks) All same old piece of perfect salmon on a white plate with five asparaguses one inch away, no sauce a'tall ...
(off-panel) Say, this place looks good! Pull over, Beef!
What... what happened, man?
It's five AM, chochacho!  You ready to gruzzle down some cheese omelettes, or you want to watch Braveheart again first?
They just playin' with expectations, man.
So, like, I think the reason Howard Stern is popular is that he hell of rags on dykes, but he also hell of esteems them, because they got, like, brass Fallopian tubes.
Man, I got to disagree.  Just--
You're damn right I said I rocked a whiskey dick all night!
This is my call-up!
I'm chompin' mignon on Bellagio lake,
Weed, it's what's for dinner.  Puff, puff, puff.  Oh me, oh my.
Simple, dude. Get her some silver thing from Tiffany. That blue box is all you need, dogg.
Life is never neat; life is always bad.
Jesus, Lonis!  What happened to the dude got him parked that way?
Huh. Good point. Okay, be from London.
What?  Waterbury?  That you?
Might as well, dude.  That stuff don't hurt me no more.
Almost there. Have Judi wearin' a kimono when she slides the tempura shrimp off the "Wok-Fitted Four-at-Once Submersible Stainless Steel Tempura Shrimp Skewer Rack."
I am wearing some delicious cologne. Let's get inside, already!
Hey Beef! I got all the magazines I wanted! You ready to take off and get some Hunan Palace?
Plus I hear they got a real good discount rehab track at this place.
Thank you, Uncle Culpepper! You must be hungry! What can I get us to eat? Come inside!
Huh. Closer, but I don't want to do that either.
Tina, baby! Take me back! Please!
What in HELL are you talkin' about?!
It's all about denyin' expectations at this level. It's like, what do we really know about a nacho?
Okay, Penny.  Drive safe now.
Heh heh! Dang, Beef!
Well, I'm having some trouble with Dirt Man Idiot, this new talent I just signed, and he's just kinda bein' my sounding board. He's cool that way.
Here.  I'll stand by with the glasses while you unscrew the lid and dip in the ladle.  You ready?
Mom?
What? You thought of a name for it too? Come on, mom! No you didn't!
Invented by the dudes from ABBA, the Isosceles Lock has revolutionized...
No, man, it was already like this. Some guy with a mustache came runnin' outta here just before me.
The Taliban bartender is like, "Man! I just have got to know what that's all about! I mean, the bird thing!"
But what about its missiles?!
Téodor! Good morning! It's Ray Smuckles, down at the agency-
Did a reader submit that sentence for use in this phone call?  Is that how this works?
Whew. Yeah, yeah. Right. Exactly. Listen, you got like e-mail access or anything?
Heh! What ever happened with that, anyway?
Followed by the Quenelle de Foie Gras.
You mean...
Dang, good idea! I'll call Rudy in production and we'll send promo samples to convalescent homes around the world.
Not anymore.
I tell you Lyle. When I was younger, I could do anything with a computer. I could turn it on, make it list the files that it had...
What? What? WHAT?
This show stone cold blows! I'm gonna go outside and have a smoke.
We should go campin'!
Oh, it has all this GPS and phone and camera and internet and stuff, but the coolest thing is that it generates a diary about me!
Yeah, I need a picture of the guys from Steely Dan where one of them is from America's Test Kitchen and the other one has been interrupted from a phone call where he was trading Russian teenagers for diamonds.
...and this one will make you boisterous and friendly, but in a way that will be too strong for some people.
[after pause] DO... DO NOT CUT IT OUT OF YOU!  NO ONE CAN HEAR UNDERWEAR ONCE IT'S INSIDE OF YOU!
Hey man!  They' some freaky chicks on that Internet!  Just start composin' and let's see how it goes!
No worries. Here, it’s your present!
Hey Roast Beef!  Is this a real equation?
Get in, man! I need a hand here! Hurry!
This was Trent Reznor's high school car!  If you sit in it, you are guaranteed to feel total despair!
Well, what do you think?
Philippe, can you see yourself with all of your egg- and milk-tracking problems
Man, let's get outta here!
Ahem... everybody, about  a year ago I wrote this speech for my oldest friend Roast Beef. I tucked it away in my coat just for tonight.
I ain't look the damn guy up!  He's usin' a FAKE NAME, dude!  "Leon Sumbitches"?  Come on.
It's my new therapy I been goin' to.  Every time I feel insecure about something', I teach myself to draw a really high-quality picture of it.
This month's Playboy Advisor says that the parietal lobe is the part of the brain that controls hand-eye coordination.
Only about that wackity-ass Nativity scene! Don't get greedy now!

Come on, Pat!  Focus!
He used to stick a match up my hiney when I had trouble makin' doodie!
I can't offer you any severance, but I did make you a mix tape. Here you go.
That son of a bitch set this whole thing up?!
[i]Italian comes on the side 'cause you gotta shake it![
Alright, you win. Seborrheic dermatitis, huh?
No, his stuff is even dumber.  It's like,  >
Lyle, man!  We gotta call it quits!  No more joint company!
You know, my grandfather, Antonyne Cheops Smuckles, was a bluesman before blues was regarded in most homes.
Jeez, man.  Alright, yeah.  Yeah, I'll take it.  Shit, dude.
I look just like Bogart! Pretty cool, huh!
Huh? Oh, hey Beef.
I won fifty-eight bucks off the dog! That stupid bastard.

Let's everybody say somethin' nice about Roast Beef while we wait out here for the doctor, OK?
Oynay oblempray, hombre.
OH DEAR GOD NO!
Oh!  Oh!  McDonald's!  Let's stop!
Please don't ask me to reconsider.
Yeah, I had a good little chat with Pat yesterday.  Let him know we're all cool with him bein' gay and stuff.
Okay then! How do I beat this dude's ass like a bongo drum?
It's like watchin' the moonwalk, you know? At first it seems all crazy and wrong, but then It's like, "at least SOMEBODY'S havin' fun!"
Everything's cool! No one got burned on this deal!
Hey Beef! Can you find any computer on the Internet just from an email you got?
Hey hey hey, Roast Beef! How's my music video script comin'?
Ask yourself, what would really set a taco stand apart from the rest?  If the public could know that they were eating a safe, clean taco! That's all there is to it!
Thank you, AmINaked!
Dang, I wish I could, Téodor. I gotta answer all these letters to my advice column!
Beef!  Come on over, dude!  We rallyin' for your bachelor party!
Anyway, Ray Smuckles is sorry he was crass to you last week!
Say, this place looks good! Pull over, Beef!
Oh, it's okay Dr. Andretti. I've just been pluckin' out my pubic hair and putting it in this Pepsi can.
We doin' this! We Can Do This! Forget about Todd!
Oh! Yeah! Thanks for remindin' me.
Okay then, T.  Bloody Mary bong it is!  Thanks!
Maybe get him a nice home defibrillator or CPR kit that has a foot pump so you ain't got to put your mouth on nobody.
I ain't tell you about that? Thing was a total hassle. I ended up sellin' it to some friend I don't know anymore. Anyhow, turns out the thing was made in Mexico. I bet if you scratch the Made in China sticker off your camera, it says Hecho en Mexico dude.
You were like the Martha Steward of condoms, all finding new and clever household uses for them!
Aww, look at him all asleep on his side.  What a cute kid.
Hi. Specialty MeatCo? Yeah, it's Mr. Red. Password 0509971

I believe it was Voltaire who said "well, then fuck them."
Oh! Yes! I did lose my British accent! I must have left it in the hearse!
Alright, thanks Aaron.
Well shit, man! Let's wrap that sucker up! Where those Tofutti-Cuties at?
Yo Connie! What's with the funny hat? You goin' outside to bug people?
Beef? Yeah, hey man. What's up? Listen, do you remember me doin' anything last night that might get me on Russel Simmons' bad side?
Look, Beef!  I just drew all these dots around my arm like I was Frankenstein!
Check it out, TÃ©odor!  I bought some old-fashioned porno on eBay!  Ain't it neat?
The new bling, all.  Liquored-up fogeys sayin' 60-proof history sasses.  All flankin' you.
Completely on accident!
Well, that's Showbiz for you.  Guy could party with a Dutch oven if he wanted to.
You break the hell back IN to that place!
Dude, I drew a mouse gettin' shot in the head! You think it looks real? Be nice, man!
Funny how Photoshop disagrees.
I know. Come on over and have a drink.

{{Voice over}} Oh! Yeah! And I'd trade it all in a minute to have been President of the Equation of the Week club!
I can't drive cars.  Or at least, I wouldn't let myself.  Not until I discovered Prosciuttolax.  Now I drive cars every day, usually about six times.
It wasn't all bad! Remember that one guy who came out to tell us that the Pirates of the Caribbean was broken? He looked kind of like a fat Puerto Rican George Clooney!
...Boned?
Lyle, you communicate mainly through smells and peeing, yet you couldn't get along with the dog.
Come on, Roast Beef! You ain't never been with a lady robot! How you know you won't like it?
Of COURSE I think that people who use Yahoo Personals eat Nachos at each meal.
EEEAUGH!
Hey, did Pat's fancy new hat!
We must make the ultimate saacrifice, then: our own enlightenment.  We must destroy this technology.

Hm. This ain't enough. What else is really offensive? Quick, what comes to mind?
Whoah! That's ill! I don't need that kind of advice!
Here, just open it up to any old page. You about to get hit in the eyes with some cask-strength gay, brother.
Alright, man.  Just play it safe, you know?
Damn. That is a thing, isn't it?
Hm. Can I still call my junk my "rad chilies"?
What in hell do you THINK it means?! Oh, and I already GOT plans for tomorrow, so you can go Tofuck yourself!
Don't you threaten me! I was doin' you a favor!

Take a hike, advice. I'm crackin' this sucker wide open.
Daaamn. Fine brown liquor?! I better drink this right away before it gets TOO fine!
My fans roll all real in sleek black Escalades!
Why you think you need to document my reply? You think I'm gonna say yes and then bail?
Everybody else, maybe? Like I said, you have a really selfish idea of how to die from helicopters!
What? No, I don't want to buy no damn piano!  Do you know what time it is?!  Don't call here--
>
Dogg, how silly would a little Jesus quail look with a beard and a robe!
No.
I know.
you can stay in here and watch this show that totally SUCKS!
You ain't had to finish off every single bite, dude.  That was your call.
[[contemplating, rubbing his paw against his chin as he looks at Nightlife]] Interesting.
Hi, man.
HISSSSS!
Wait! ...it's time for my back medicine.
Okay.  Lord of the Rings was huge.  Nobody needs to say that.  Way I see it, you guys help to meet the demand people got for elf-battle stuff in the wake of those films.  Put another way, Prime Time Records is proud to represent Mister Band.  Welcome.
Oh! Dude! That stings! Ow, stop sayin' that you take a shower!Robert Smith cannot HEEEAR YOOUUUUUU!
Nah, I'm takin' him down to the Dementia Arms to clean up for a few days.
See, you know how weddings are dumb-expensive, and the bride's family usually pays, only your bride ain't got one?
Who, Pat? Who you goin' after?
Hello, gentleman!  Could I interest you in a fine ale, and perhaps our special half-pound Ahi burger?
What? Oh, no, mann! I got this on eBay!
It's like, you shouldn't eat an animal unless you're capable of killin' it with your own hands.
I'm sorry Phillippe. Dressing up like cowboys just isn't... just isn't cheering me up at all.
That pretty much how it goes?
Man, I dig this font thing!  I'm gonna make myself a logo!
You feel like you got to take care of everybody, man.  That chick probably needs you like she needs a hot shovel.
Let's say you on the road, you know, and you ain't got your crew with you.
Let's make you kind of dangerous, like an ex-007 in hiding!
Who! Damn, but did I need that nap!
Yeah, I think it was fake. There was an article about him in the newspaper.
How's that, Stanley?
Alright, good news. Philippe's floatin' in a cooler about two hundred yards offshore.
Damn, Lyle!  I forgot Tina's birthday again!
Whoah! That's a neat idea, T! Beef could cut a pretty sharp figure if he had some help!
You know, before he left, Roast Beef and I always said that we were gonna start a rap company someday...
Yo Connie! You in here? I gotta get some advice off 'a you, man!
Yeah! And get this -- the train stops for a minute at a *tiny little classical music concert!*
Roast Beef! Emergency party at my place! Call everyone you know!
Tell you what.  Bring me a bottle of your most on-the-house wine, and I'll let you smell my Caddy.  Oh, and six bucks for the meat. I know you got to make a profit.
Sorry, fella. Fuck you.
Hey, that's Godfather of SOULS to you!
All this time, you felt like you couldn't even say anything!  I'm sorry, man.  I...I ain't even know which end is up anymore.  This whole thing...damn.
Being the same age, I was recruited to be his peer and observe him as he, "grew up."
What do you want to do with all the money from the card line?
That car is fantastic. I'm not kidding.
Nice. Alright, time to film me bustin' through the wall and yellin' at him. Then you can edit this all together, year?
Gary Sinise? Who's that?
What's a good remedy?
Dude's marryin' his maid again?  What's that, number eleven?
See now Lyle, I ain't really into the whole leprechaun-rock thing.  Strikes me as foolish.  But puttin' out music's in my blood, and part of puttin' out music means believin' in somethin' you don't believe in.
Yo yo, T!  You ready to get on up in the Roast Beef bachelor party train?
Extremely interesting.  Would need to change the name for mass-marketing, though.
It's like a sex position.  But it's also kind of like a sex
No, Really! They are realy silly people! Stop listening to them!
No I didn't! I never bailed on you for lunch before.
You know what we oughta DO?!
. . . your LABEL!
So, like I was sayin'! When you gonna drop the ring on Molly, Beef?
Yo Beef! Let's do up a little "couples' dinner party" for Connie and that new chick! Make sure she ain't just playing him for a sugar daddy with a bum ticker, you know?
Oh, no WAY is he playin' this heavy metal bull-crap in MY house!
Uh...yeah! Of course you can buy one, mom!
You...you hid the Keith Moon head before he cound find it, right?
Don't yell at me!  You think I think this is right?  Are you CRAZY?!
I mean, you ever met a Polish dude? They're little, and they can be pretty mad if someone is messing around, but they ain't dumb.
After you've all gone, the prisoner will tell us who he thinks was the most believable!
We'll get Ruffles, turn on some music! Here, here's your 7 & 7.
Looks like a pretty expensive shoe...
Not today, man. Fuck you.
Oh, just workin' on ideas for my New Years card. Got my childhood cooler here.
We gotta start us a advertising agency, dogg!
It would make me doodie every time!
He's posin' as this guy Silver_Screen_Promos, and he's just workin' me.
Oh! T! Idea! You think that's vodka his head is suspended in?
Would you like some more code, mom?
Beef, dogg. Bad news, man. You seated?
Golf Golf Golf Revolution.
Diabetes, you are not invited to my pizza party.
...you ask me, they should be sharp as HELL...
Hey, man. I need you to emcee this lesbian erotica contest I got about to start. Wear this, cool?
You're sayin' I park like a bitch! I ain't park like a bitch! Retract, dude!  Retract.
Hello- Cathy?
I KNOW, MAN! I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN!
We talkin' 'bout makin' dirt here, Pat! Dirt ain't exactly nature's choosiest substance when it comes to havin' recently been other stuff!
Sorry, mom. I was readin' that book about college dares from the '20s again.
I thought about this financial crisis from all angles, dogg.  We gotta legalize and tax pot.  That could really be the big save.
Nice work down there, by the way. Can I get you a soda or anything? I mean, I should have gotten you a soda.
I actually want it to be hella interestin' and sad -- kind of end on a massive heart attack in the gutter sort of note ---
So, Roast Beef, how are those new features coming?
So what if I am?
No, dude. Their food is as greasy as a ladies' sex dancer. Go order us up some Steamed China.
Hey Teodor! It's Ray! How you doin'?
Holy Crap! Bensington Butters just launched a premium clothing label, entered treatment for painkiller addiction, AND made the Al Qaeda death list!
But this is a Mustang>, baby!  Don't you want to do it under a
I don't like what you're doing here. I don't feel like I have a lot of outs.
Man, let's get OUTTA here!
Oh CRAP I got to call Beef!
Huh?  Stones?
You're all played out Marmaduke!  You're all washed up!  No one gets why you're still around!  People whisper about this to each other!
ALRIGHT!  Alright!  So I musta read the directions wrong!
YOU GONNA STAND THERE WITH YOUR BUTT ON THE BACK OF YOUR BODY OR ARE YOU GONNA GET IN ON THIS, BEEF?
You know what the problem is with taco stands? Trust.  I see a taco stand, I'm thinkin bad thoughts.  I'm thinking', I will get an oral disease or else get the papillomavirus.
Oh, I'll get some of the other big bands from my label. Don't you worry.
Right. Where we go from there?
So, yeah, I'm thinkin' just throw some food words in the yupscale supercollider ...
[thinking] He wrote!
Alright!  It's go-time, dude!  You need a little fix 'a diamond juice?
Oh, and take my spare two-way mobile so you can lay it on your dresser and we can jam hands-free later!
Okay, yeah, I see it. Thanks. That's Perfect.
[[thinking]] Huh... what should I yell... Wait, what direction do I go in, even? Crap, dude.
Connie! A beautiful lady! Why is this happening to me? Did I overpay my taxes?!
Aw, it's real easy, Beef!
Why does this all seem so... familiar...
I tell you, one thing I cannot abide is guys with a tattoo on their ass cheek. I gotta draw the line. Back me up, Beef.
That ain't the police! That's the company that looks after my Harman Kardons!
Yeah! Yeah! I did! I put in one called "Photoshop"! Is that bad? Is that a pretty bad program?
Shut up, Lazarus! It ain't even light out!
Oh, uh...computers are kind of like... they're like a machine that is really smart and can play chess with you and stuff.
Um...uh...it's OK, dude! Listen, I was just makin' up about those J-cups! I was just tryin' to impress you! Beef? Beef?
Dude. You know what it is? This camera is showin' how you FEEL about yourself, not your actual self
Alright, time to execute on Operation Horrible Front Yard. Where we at, T?
Pat, man! I compost now! I'm just like you!
That seems unlikely.
We got to start us a advertising agency, dogg!
Hold on, Beef!  Now, don't be mad!  Is the baby...right about...here?
THE HOSE!
Come on baby! Take Ray's money!
Alright!  It ain't like anything actually happened!
I ain't "of gravity!" I'm in good shape!
Don't you do cocaine at ME, you son of a bitch!
I throw leftovers on the ground, man! In a little wire cage!
A completely colden family-size pizza from Papa Tony's?
For twelve hours my ass ain't smokin', slippin' down gold Johnny Blues, dry-steamin*, grufflin' the popper sampler at Burger Crater, or takin' in impure ideas through the eyes.
You'd be surprised, T.  Gay guys think like in an instant.
The way mom tells it, Rustmouth was a bitter man, soured on beer, and given to claims.
I've got to sell this on eBay.
Man, that movie's CORNY! You only want to watch it because you've got a big crush on Molly Ringwald!
Little NEPHEW?  In the jacuzzi?!  Oh my god!
Dude, way too long. The Fully Automated Vesuvio Espresso Station has too many features to detail. It's flagship. Just have 'em sweat-butt bucking' next to the thing.
Consider it done! Mind if we add olives and mushrooms?
Look at you, all dressin' the fool! What's gotten into you Little Nephew?
Heh! I'm like the Donald Trump of homeless people!
Teodor.  It is the morning after Halloween.
They have this way of shaping a fried egg to look like a top hat, dammit!
...aaand we'll cut that last bit in post. Lunch!
Hard to explain. You . . . you ever snoop around in your parents' room and find, like, soft-focus boudoir pics of your mom wearin' red silk gloves and hella Aqua Net?
Listen, Beef. There's no easy way to say this...
It's a police scanner, dude! This crap is hilarious!
No.  You're saying that because you want to be discovered.  You still have ego.  You want recognition.
Oh, I was just helpin' out a friend. We take this thing for a spin?
Lessee here..."The Knights - Love NOT Hate - Racialist Power Rally 2005." Here's their letter:
Wait... maybe I can. I need to see this as a challenge.
Ooh, like all in tiny panties and a hat?
Ooh...man.
It smells like someone's working on a car!
Sayyy it, Pat!  You just wanted to smell my dirty laundry, didn't yyyou?
Heh! Whatever happened with that, anyway?
Okay, fine!  Hold on.
Don't wear a cape!
Yes, this is Mr. Smuckles. I understand there's been a disturbance in my home?
Yeah...and maybe some chips.
Well, I think it's because we runnin' Apache on FreeBSD.  Yeah, swap space keeps fillin' up.  Repartition?  Wait, Mike, did you touch the NIC?  I can't ping it.
No, little guy! Here --
'Cause they care how their shit smells.
Yo mama's so poor, Somalia sent her a cup of water with plastic wrap over the top!
Just got to tuck this in the tux, I'm done!
Now you talkin' with bacon, Pat! Dayum!
That starts the Marseillaise, right? And where do the anti-abortion protestors with the bloody fetus posters go?
I can't believe you moved out on Grandma K, dude. Who's gonna take care of her?
gonna skip a day
Crap, dude. Nuts.
Nah, I don't think it'll get in the papers. I have the guys cuss at one point.
Look at it this way. If you think about it, what was the worst aspect of the 1980s? >
Doggz 2 Tha *Bizzone*...hmm... yeah! I kinda like that!
Let me know if you need any help.
I wonder what the best thing to do is.
So, Pat, what's caviar like? Pretty good?
Watchu doin' lettin' this Jehovah's Witness bother you, Beef?! I thought you had any sense!
Yes please!
Holy crap! Cornelius? Lyle? What are you guys doin' in here waitin' for videol colonoscopies?
Boss kaleidoscope, Beef!
Advice columnists are kind of a unique lot, like blimp pilots, in that we're mostly self-taught.
But, dude! Think how perfect!
Whatchu mean that's a lot to ask?!  Who loaned you his putter on sixteen yesterday? That's what I thought, forgetful homeboy. We gonna call you in ten, be ready.
Hey T!  What's the hap-haps, man m' man?
This was Trent Reznor's high school car! If you sit in it, you are guarenteed to feel total despair!
I picture them jumping off of high cliffs into water, feasting on wild game and fruits, and visiting the women when more children were needed.
*"Cool! Which one?"*
How'd we do, dad? How'd we look?
All meetin' some ladies, invitin' em to our tent!
Let's go check out the dance floor, fellows.
Throwin' Lyle's liquor away is like pickin' a fight with a meat packing plant!
Uh, that kind of brings us to a tricky subject, Beef. Only one man can win this thing, right?
Gonna make 'em a new one. Go get my digital camera. You can still do Photoshop stuff, right?
Heyo! Ray Smuckles here! Who's callin'?
Todd! Get away! This ain't a party of crap dudes!
You should be at home, practicing your musical instrument! Run along now!
I guess that's called a "Whole Enchilada"? They actually see it pretty often, they said, what with Iraq War and all. I had to talk to a suicide counselor before they'd let me leave.
Ain't you gotta talk on the phone to your mom about how the baby opened its left eye or something?
They go out into the woods and they find a really poor beetle who's tryin' to find a used car to take his daughter to college. The guy has ruined credit, and zero savings, and right in front of his daughter the salesman throws him out on his collar. Literally. He drops his hat and the salesman kicks it to him. He has to bend over to pick it up.
Oh, it's Little Nephew. He cut this album speakin' out against algebra and I'm pretty upset with him.
Sure as hell, blochicho! What else you got?
Huh?  Oh, I just wanted to see if I could run my own web server.  It ain't some big deal like the main nerds would have you believe.  This crud is fly-easy if you can make yourself care.
It's a historical pubic wig from when prostitutes had to shave "down there" because of lice and stuff!
It's Ray, sweet thang! Whooo yeah! You feelin' me, baby?
You know what else don't smoke, drink, or tap ass on a lazy Tuesday mornin'? Grocery carts with rain on the handle.  Tanks.  Morrissey. You ain't rad for suckin'; you're lame for bein'.
Yeah, uh, just get us started. Thanks Jai.
I was tryin' to think of ways to top your bachelor party, but this is all I could come up with.
TÃ©odor's "Howard Jones" blanket?
Riddle! What's the sound of a million Italian caper bowls gettin' sold? The sound of this piece of paper, existing.
Don't tell me he's dead, Dr. Andretti! Say it ain't so!
But he knows I don't know that.
HEY! Who put a hair on my dang nachos?
Dude, what are you wearing? That ain't like you!
Who?  What?
"What any man wants! To meet the Hardys!" laughed Ray. Everyone chuckled with relief. It was good to see that the new city fellow knew who was who.
Good, good!  Let 'em know you a kinky dogg!
At first, yeah. It was hard to come to where I'm at now. Lots of long walks, lots of late-night calls. But I'm resigned to it. I'm at peace with this process.
Totally.  So, you take it in the can now!  That's different.
Alright, you want a beer or anything? Help yourself - I put some Coronas in the mini-fridge before I left.
I know the photo shoot you're thinkin' of--that one where both dudes have those yellow suede workboots?  --but in reality the Wrangler is a totally horrible car.  Thing handles like a damn keg.
Good!  Now you simply engage her interests!
Well, I'd have to rewrite the entire thing. I'd rather just let my art live or die as it is, you know?
No they ain't gonna know just by lookin' in your eyes! Act normal, and get on the damn plane! We filmin' our first episode tonight, Todd!
What? No, I don't want to buy no damn piano! Do you know what time it is?! Don't call here-
A few scholarly works state that he claims to have had the first group sex in America -- though recently unearthed wax recordings have him saying that he didn't much like it. Here, I have 'em on my iPod.
[[Singing into microphone]] OH BABY I AIN'T GOT NO MONEY
I got a damn hemorrhoid, man!
Candle at both ends, though. Harsh.
Seriously, Beef, if movin' in with that broad is gonna burn you on the molars, you gotta pull the brake. Sickin' up breakfast is nature's way of telling you to reconsider your situation!
Oh, hold on, Connie. I'm gettin' another call.
Anyhow, the lawyer looks at him pretty mean, because in their religion it's, like, super rude to be nosy
I'm sorry Phillippe.
shut the hell up dick
Did...did I mention that we have an installment plan?
[[Yelling to Beef]] It ain't even a real LLLLLIMO!
Don't talk!
Man, what is the matter with me? I just called my best friend a butthole!
He says they got four new Subways in the neighborhood since we left!
I have a Platinum Reserve account.  Kind of like their black market.
Naw, man. I been hella klondike lately! Sheesh. Even in my fantasies I just go to the library and read about coins. Somethin's got to give, man. I got to go to a nudist colony or somethin', just like run at people and see what happens. See if it winds up as sex. That's basically the only option I got left.
RAAAAAY
OK. So I start to give him a backrub, but then I surprise him by kicking his ass. Right.
Awesome.  Where are you?
Yeah, it was! Whole lot better than learnin' to understand Spanish!
Wait, what?
Well, first of all you got to have sexual relations! You can't get in alone!
You ran the dude's credit?
You got SOME NERVE makin' fun of my high school grades, Mr. Quotes Tori Amos During His Salutorian Address
Roast Beef! How do I protect my computer from Spy-Ware?
Normal.  I feel really normal.
Man, look at that poor guy! He's like some kinda weed-head Oregon caveman!
Everybody Dance...
A butthole!
I just think it might be polite if you told people you were from a place they hadn't heard of, you know?
Daaamn! I'm gettin' me some Scallops FlambÃ© and crackin' us some MoÃ«t!
I'm thinking of gettin' him a little sedan or something, you know, maybe in a week or two.
This ain't my victory.
Naw, but Fuck You for actin' like I'm gonna solve all the world's problems with my car!
Kid kid kid! What's with all this kid imagery? Did you just see a kid? I play with this truck!
about to gruffle some mad Domino's
Roast Beef! Why are you programming that computer?
Whew! Ok, yeah. Here we go!
Nothing!  Let's go have some McDon--OH MY GOD THE PAIN
-=Ray=-
DO YOU WANT TO SAY HI?
don't sass me, chucklehead. i gave you a real basic two-option question.
Oh, look. He forgot his newspaper!
Now, what's one thing everybody's has? A cell phone.
Yeah, sorry about that.
Salad dressing all in some stainless steel five-bowl server caddy...
Cool, thanks. Say, B, how you set for wheels these days? I got one of those new Hummers but it's hell on my lumbar.
Damn, man.  I think Tina wants to get back with me.
Man, you dumbass squirrels ain't nothin' but trouble! I don't want any of this!
The Grenchmen.
That, and he shot Beef, and borrowed a bunch of money from me, and he's got Little Nephew walkin' and talkin' like a pissed-off bottle of Wild Turkey, plus he-
Nonsense!
Hey, Phillipe! Here's a fiver. Pick me up a pack of lucky strikes.
Yo, Tina. Guess there ain't no use pretendin' this ain't me. How you been girl.
Dang, Beef, He was all | up in my shit! What was I | supposed to do, dogg?
Did you know that he has it in his contract that you have to look into his eyes?
Au contraire, talkin' Pat. Look at it this way...
Hurry, Doc! Cold fix him up! Put it all on my tab, every penny!
Dogg! It's good to see you!
What's... where's... how do I even begin to describe your pants
A DOO DA DOO DA DOO DA DOO!
Can this wait?
You're stupid! You shouldn't even care!
Heyyyy, who invited Pat?
Well, one thing led to another.  You can pretty much guess what they did.  It wasn't too cool.
Fuck him! Jokin' around ain't supposed to BE hard work!
It's just nerves, dogg! Get on out that stage and be born ANEW!
I think it's mainly computers, man. We got so much stimuluses, we ain't need to use our imagination anymore, and it dies like a muscle that ain't get used!
I hope you didn't want more of a fuss -- I couldn't figure out that dang "E-Vite" thing at all
YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU KNOW WHAT?
Alright Philippe, here's your list of photo ops for tomorrow.
TÃ©odor! What's his tab lookin' like?
Oh, just tryin' to get back in the game.
Oh, get out! He used to butler for James Brown? How come he quit?
Here you go, T!  Merry Christmas.  Sorry I didn't get this to you on the big day.
It's like, every lady got a rump!  No two ways about it!  But...fat titties, man!  They like the truffles of the lady-body community!
You're terrible!
Yeah, I guess I don't really have a choice. Sure, five hundo. Let me know when he wants to start takin' notes. Jesus. Thanks a lot, Pat.
OH, HOW THE PEOPLE WILL MARCH!
They all soft an' crappy! How long ago did you fry them?
(beatboxing) uh-pfuh uh-pssssh uh-pfuh uh-pssssh
You have reached Raymond Smuckles. I regret that for personal reasons I must not ride in a car that smells like Awesome Blossoms. Please leave a message.
As you know, the Eliminator was the only choice that fit the following four Badass car categories:
HAH!
Cool!  And not even a down payment!
Awesome!
A doo-da doo-da doo-da do!
Alright, all the doors are locked. Let's get back to work.
Interesting.  Okay, on a scale of one to ten, I need you to do a skit where you wear nylons... and drink from a chamber pot.
Anyhow, be quiet.  I got to call my mom back.
We had raps about shooting out windows, we had raps about what it might be like to have eye problems, about how you shouldn't hit yourself when you make a mistake... all sorts of stuff.
I ain't gonna say anything, but your camera has Mexican magical realism. Same thing happened to me last year when I bought that RV where it was always rainin' inside.
Well, I'm gonna save 'em the walk. You dopes stay here and keep up the great work.
Beef, I'm gonna be SICK if I gotta keep holdin' onto this thing!
So they named you Roast Beef?!
YOUR BODIES SHALL ROLL IN GREAT TUBS OF LICE!
Damn. Cartilage Head, huh. I really wasn't ready for that this week.
Pickin' up a lady is the easiest thing in the world!  Here now -- Just say your name...
What did you just say?!
FOREVER?!
Huh! You know, I always wanted to act out a big old dramatic death scene.
Trans Am...Trans Am...oh!  That's my Trans Am.  Is that where it is?
Philippe, I'm going to sneak into the house and check things out. You stay here by this ugly plant.
Heh, no kiddin'.  So, I'm tryin' to plan a honeymoon they'd like, but I got a bad case of player's block.
HEY!
We're in here, dogg!
Peanuts are health food. Everybody knows that.
Roast Beef! These chimichangas are terrible!
Pretty slow, Todd.
How was your weekend, Pat? You get any of the sweet stuff?
Well, check it out.  See this month's featured tostada? What do you notice about it?
PAT!
Spill, Beef. A brother is tore up on toxic shock syndrome and rockin' a Schedule III Sodium Pentothal* in his gravy.
Oh well, best try to get some nutrition goin' on here.
Yeah, man! Yeah
Pat's cursed to be gay?
Wow!
Ain't nobody in the place would step to me if I was sippin' real with a hot-cuss granny and a fifth 'a Benedictine!
Pretty much.  But like I told you: my treat. Wasn't your idea.
Seriously man.  Four years, dude.  They had their downs.  They had their move-outs and ugly public fights.  Those cats are cosmic like end of days.  Time to execute!
You know what? When a man is afraid of an e-mail, it's time to redistrict the comfort zone.
Tina?
I guess you are becoming a man now, Little Nephew. My, where do the years go.
What are they doin' way the heck out in Pat's neighborhood?
Wait â THE Rustmouth?!
I...hold on, what?
Nah, it's just one of those fake-outs where they show him on the box.  This one just has some Mexican guy with a knee brace.
WHAT!  What in the HELL!  DAMN you!
Téodor!  We gonna take off now!  It was a real good time, dig?
It helps you make tasty little meals!
Ain't you the one who just got sent home with lice?
Heh heh! That's just like somethin' she would say, isn't it?!
You got a boat, Teodor?!
Naw, man! I don't use no chumpy Yahoo Personals! Talk about your people who eat Nachos at every meal!
nein.
Pat! Merry Christmas! Sorry I didn’t see you on the big day. I’m still runnin’ around droppin’ off presents!
Well, I'm thinkin' about gettin' me some nipple rings. You know?
Of course, it doesn't stop there.  We need to think of our platinum clientele.  The creme de la creme.
Téodor, I really don't---
We recommend it with a cilantro-ape ceviche.
That's it?! You gotta think big, Beef! You gotta buy a baseball team or a Bentley or something!
Sorry, dogg.  Just you and him.  You know he kicked Lyle out, right?  Just for sayin' his own ideas?
Whoever left this out here is hella lucky I found it!
All-RIGHT! Let's get us on down to that graveyard and hella start munchin' on some skeleton bones!
Nice Pete sings these really bonkers lyrics over a bass line.  It's like that black elf-rock stuff? Is that what I mean?  From Norway?
Two weeks later I wake up in a tub full of ice, barely able to bid for my own kidneys on eBay!
You know, I been readin' a lot about that lately.
Could somebody hit up the B-string pretty loud and first gimme a...a few seconds notice!
I wonder if eBay gives an award for blowing people's minds.
This is my new Whiskey a la Mood sampler!
Oh, nothin'... just this MIX TAPE.
It's designed to accompany Delta bluesmen. Watch.
I vote you off of this island, little free verse MacGyver!
Yo mama so crass, she smokes a cigar and eats shrimp cocktail on the bus!
Pat, did yyyyyou steal my laundry!
I don't know! Golf clubs? You know how searches take you off on tangents!
Aw, don't worry Pat!  He don't ejaculate!
[thinking] Man, I wouldn't know how to buy a coat in Germany even if I HADN'T spent all my euros on soda.
You would cut off your own face if people thought you lost a fight to me.
Teodor! You gotta come over and help me write a follow up hit to Friendship Lane!
Oh...hey, T. You never call me anymore.
What's the deal with Polack jokes, man?
Kief? Jay? Shake? Kingston Sideburn?  I ain't picky, dude.
I'm sorry. My...uh... my colleague is a terrible man.
I ain't wear aviators and have chemistry people hair!
Téodor, man, we gotta hit the drawing board!
Think! Who's hot right now...Ellen. Many of the Yankees. That American Idol judge who came from England...that's it! Him! Simon Le Cowell!
Check it, they got a "random" button! Fortune favors the brave, dogg!
It was the damn sour cream lid, alright? It slipped!
No, don't cry! You are rad! You are a rad friend!
Dude, shut the hell up! That ain't no fun! A contest got to be fun!
Beef! BEEF!
Serious as hell, brochicho! Come join my gym! They just gave me a free membership you can have!
Daaamn! Interesting idea! HELL of interesting! "Custom novels where people you hate end up chumped!"
Yeah!  I think the only store my mom even KNOWS about is Neiman Marcus!
Teodor! You throwin' me a party? I'm touched!
Teodor!  Nooo!
Of COURSE I think that people who use Yahoo Personals eat nachos at each meal.
Well, there's this priest, and he's pretty down on his luck.
Of course they'll let you on the plane!  Just don't act like anything's wrong!
Alright Beef! Come on out and show us the new you!
That's when they caulk the gap between the bowl and the seat with wet TP to create a perfect seal.
Are you kidding?
Good
[[on phone]] Yeah, flowers go without sayin'.  But seriously, dogg, you're in card territory.
I came to pick your amateur ass up.  Now let's hustle before that gold diggin' peanut slinger wanders out here in some frou-frou negligee that makes us ALL look cheap.
...and "B," you need to calm down. We'll find Philippe using Airwolf, don't worry.
Dang, Beef! I can't eat this much jalapenos!
Daaamn, no operating costs!  I like your model!
Man, when was the last time I was on eBay?! I'm craaazy for that shit!
Let's see... let's breathe a bin 281 for the meats but start off with the JouÃ«t.
Hey Beef!  You ever taste sugar cookies?  I just -
Huh. Yeah, I guess when you think about it, James Brown IS ridiculous.
No, man. I didn't.
Pat already took?
Seriously? Envelópe Martinez? Fight Champion 1997? Nice!
Dang, people! Hello and good morning! Listen, today is a very special day around here.
Yeah, I know the feeling. More cod?
Would you like some more cod, mom?
(thinking) Daaamn, Doc Andretti drives a green Miata?  I thought doctors had good cars...
Simon Le Cowell! Nice to talk to you!
Yeah, I guess you're right!  The dude is sick!  Probably had issues potty training!
Grrr! GRRRR!
N-no...?  If you don't get off my property and create an exclusive Jehovah Witnesseyism franchise, so help me I will hunt you down and treat you like the dopeman did Strawberry.
He is the main goth in this whole area! You gotta pull water with him or you're NOBODY!
All laughin' and tellin' lies!
Yeah... I started to go into withdrawal there for a second!  I was sad and scared!
Yes? Hello?
...there.  Done.
Lyles Palm III?
Sorry, Jai, but we got to run. My business partner ain't feelin' too hungry.
I like your band
Hey, man! Do you want to smoke?
Man, I ain't lost. I been at Tina's.
Roast Beef! I made a really rad model train layout! Don't you want to come see it?
Check it out, dude! It's so heavy I had to use Mr. Wheels!
Be sure to tell me what you think.  I don't even know if this was the right thing to do.
Yeah, man, yeah. I like how that leg dangles off the bed. It's like, "Where does that leg go?"
HE SKATES THE DREAMS OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE NO ONE TO SPEAK FOR THEM
So, like, even the Bubble Boy could eat it?
What?  What in hell you mean you guys ain't on speakin' terms?!
Whew! did we nail that one?! Did we?
Where you no-name goons been?  Pat's comin' outta the closet!  This shit is better than Sopranos!
Is that what you really think? That I'm gonna *lie* to you?
Special?  What's special is that it looks tough as hell, and chicks will mac all over me 'til my eyes roll back in my head and I groan!
Goodnight, man.
No, I'd really feel better if you wore it.  It might fall out if you put it in your pocket.
Hey, LOOK! They got old reels of "Catfish" Lavender Cavendish!
I got no idea.  I ain't even looked inside this bad boy since I can remember.
My cordless phone accidentally picked up your call to the Queen last night.
What in hell you doin' knowin' about today's main perverts? Not a classy aspect of you, Beef.
Anyhow, get in quick here. I don't fully trust my abalone guy and I'm ten kinds of worried about that helicopter up there.
You need to admit that my dick looks better than yours.
That was his alias for Ramses Luther Smuckles.  He wouldn't fight under the family name.  That's why I never knew 'til now.
Why you think Chinese people live so long.
(thinking) A doctor should have at least an SL or a 5-Series.  A Miata is Hasbro.  Maybe he got it during residency and is just keeping the battery alive until his gardener asks for it?
You mean Guinness? Oh hell yeah! I got a whole case of it!
For half an hour, an hour, then two, the light doesn't change, and this dude is calmly examinin' his teeth the entire time. Then i get it. I scrape the sticker off the phone: "Hencho en Mexico." I turn around and drive home.
Your first challenge: BAKE A LOAF OF BREAD USING THE PROVIDED FLOUR, WATER, YEAST, AND SALT!
Hey little guy, you seen Téodor?
Heh!
What's the matter, Pat?
place is Closed
>
Oh! Téodor! Thanks for bein' the bigger man and gettin' in touch!
In closing, I guess that's why he's marryin' you, Molly. So he'll have someone to pick up the magazines off the bathroom floor! Just kiddin', girl. Much love to you two. Thank you.
Damn, T! You onto somethin' with that!
Dude, your oven fries suck! I feel like Mrs. John Lithgow when I've got one of those things in my mouth!
Okay, let's see.
That's right, sir. Based on how much eggs or milk you started with. Could I interest you in a trial version?
Huh!  Damn interesting!  Like all Philip Morris but with spliffs! Interesting!
Well, not just by watchin'... I mean, you got to do the deed, of course.
Oh god and I been in Antibes all month I ain't even got a single beverage for that guy to lever into...
So ungrateful! I bought the dude like seven hats, PLUS a Disney Fantasy Signature, and this is the thanks I get!
Okay, then just pretend that you're stickin' your tongue out.
uh-pssssh
See now Lyle, I ain't really into the whole leprechaun rock thing. Strikes me as foolish.  But puttin' out music's in my blood, and part of puttin' out music means believin' in somethin' you don't believe in.
What?  For real?
How'd he order his steak?
The only issue I got with my mom is that she loves me so much it hurts her when I am chubby.  If she could tone it down a little, I could rock a few extra pounds.
Since when do you smoke, Phillipe? And what happened to your regular, non-ridiculous pants?
You fried these chimichangas this morning?! Daaamn, Beef! I thought you had more sense!
Huh! I never thought of that!
I'd say yes twice but I'm just not feeling all that positive.
This is a good neighborhood. People pay a lot of money to not see a bunch of rotating Josephs.
[[off]] Téodor! Come take your shirt off and do jumping jacks in here! Rod ain't a Cuisinart!
Seven million units?  Excellent.  I'll have my guy draw up the papers today.
Dang, Beef! How you doing? We never know when we gonna hear from you!
Oh!  Lyle!  You sittin' in the sink!  Why come?
Daaamn, Todd! Did you lost a bunch of weight?
There ain't no secret menu.
Lyle! Since when do you lok at that kind of stuff?!
Or did your hands meet in the dumpster behind Olive garden! Scram!
s-sup (slurping martini)
"Text me if you accept this. My cell number is..."
Most interesting. Plump, soft white flesh of vanilla and melon yields as a firm hand of chocolate and clove gently pulls the tropical décolletages from her shoulders...it's a forbidden combination, culminating in an explosion of heat and musk.
Holy crap! That sorry-assed crybaby won the goddamned Survivor?!
Alright men, this is where the Badass Games get scientific!
Just make it fun to watch! That's all people want! Just make it a party!
Hold on--you already heard it?!
Uh huh. Uh huh. Keep talkin'.
Beef! Beef! Are you okay?
It's Tina's birthday tomorrow.  I owe her big after last year.
Doors of perception, life-affirming, challenging boundaries, that kind of stuff.
Oh, I get it! You want money!
Daaamn! Seven AM and nobody around for omelettes! Maybe I'll just burn one and hit the hay.
Whoah, a web cam!
Whoah, man! Don't pick me up!  What the hell, man?!
Each of you take a place at one of the five tables when I say GO!
"You and me, on a stage, compete to write the finest lesbian erotica of all time. Whoever wins becomes or already is the Founder of Williams Sonoma."
Aber, kann ich umsteigen?
Would you like some mode cod, mom?
Not this time, man! If you don't look into my eyes, the urine's gonna rise up into my heart and over-heat it and kill me!
You did that on purpose?
Whoa!  Night and day!  One more ounce and I feel FOUR times happier.
Dang there it went again! I got to call Doc Andret--
Oh my god!  Slow pitch softball!
Hawks are amazing birds, but I don't "believe" in them. That's where you run into problems.
Then the recording age came, and nobody wanted to buy a record of a notary reading a laundry list of unusual woes.
can't you...
My name's Ray, by the way.
Well , tough. It's here to stay. I look like a goddamned Musketeer and I mean to kick much ass.
THE ATOM BOMB WILL KILL US ALL! THERE'S VOMIT IN THE BATHROOM STALL!
Is everything OK? You look pretty shook up!
Would you like some mode code, mom?
Man, that cat already knew how to use the goddamn toilet.
"Dang, I never thought it would be like this!  A guy is rocking my can!"
Not only do I not have to tell you my secret recipe, but I also don't have to kill you.
(pointing at self) THIS  IS  A HOMEBOY!
That's why I can't come out all guns blazin' on, like, the history of France.
RRRR! RRRR!
Where's yours, Beef?
Christ!
It wasn't my job! Dude, the Voice Donut was strictly your touch!
Oh neat, fifty bucks!
Oh, I get it. Nice. Can't fault that.
Yeah, I think I got that one!
Man, I wonder what ever happened to Bill Cosby...
I heard that every time someone offers her a PastaPro Express Home Pasta system, she spreads her legs and thinks of England! That's all I'm sayin', dude! Calm down.
Sheesh. Dude's probably gonna do a urine in my Caddy.
I give you...Solo, by ChatSack with Karl Lagerfeld.
Yeah, that sounds about right. What's a good remedy?
Didn't they show you that video in the sixth grade?
Lyle and Rays Perfect Jays!  Dogg, I just thought up our company name! Got kind of a Tuff Gong metal shack feel!
Dude, I paid eight hundred bucks for this. Is it a total loss?
Sheesh. You say it like it's so bad.
Beef! Come on out, man! You ain't left the house since you got back! Come on over and let's crack us open some-
Crap.  Connie left his French horn under a towel in the bathroom and I crushed the main horn area.  We lookin' at a six hundo.
Heh heh! Sweat all runnin' down Uncle Ray's back, Sceptyre all cranked to the max! Whew!
Can...um, do you have a phone we can use?  We might be lost.
What's your mission? To look like some guy whose license place says RENFAIR?
I just took my homeboy to Disneyland for three days, man!  Classic knuckleheads' vacation!
What?  What do you mean my voice sounds "kind of thick"?
Huh!  It seems like he only just plays Twist and Shout!  I think I got ripped off!
Whoah!  He's a little psycho!  I want to play with that little psycho and learn his name!
Come on, Roast Beef! Come on back, and make me some Galaxy Nachos!
Check it out, Téodor! I bought some old-fashioned porno on eBay! Ain't it neat?
Mom's got it. Put it away in the hall closet at her place.
You got SOME NERVE makin' fun of my high school grades, Mr. Quotes Tori Amos During His Salutorian Address!
Good, good...
Uncle Culpepper! How was your trip? It's good to see you! Come in!
Fuck, man! I just crashed the car!
Welcome to the BADASS GAMES!
Little Nephew, did you remember to start the dishwash--well, now! Is that Vaseline? I guess it's time for "The Talk"!
JUFF A FECOND 'UDE
Huh. You might be right.
Awww yeah!  You know what I'm sayin!
So...uh...what you guys been up to?
You get back in rehab and you get a leech on you! Immediately, Todd! I'm not kidding! I had to pay for those babies up front!
That depends! Are you the Guaranteed Honky-Tonk Style Blowjob I ordered from Room Service just now?
There! Video clerk sees you slap that down on the counter, his eyes don't even focus. All the elements are perfectly balanced to turn off curiosity.
[[thinking]] But...still.  It ain't like a Smuckles to leave a player this way.  I bet Lonis can wiggle his rocks around and tidy this up.
{{thought-balloon}} How do you tell a cokehead that he ain't famous? Seems impossible... I... I got to get him on TV quick if I'm gonna cash on his crash! We ain't got no time for lunch...
Good-bye Achewood, Hellllll-o Hollywood!
Call cats know how to use the damn toilet.
Let's just say I didn't have a whole lotta scratch lyin' around...
Heh! Okay, little guy! Hop on in and we'll have us an _adventure_!
Hey Beef!  Come look at this picture of a guy who got killed by a helicopter!
Whoah, dogg. Say shucks that much on your own time, maybe like for Guinness World Records. I hear they take mp3s.
Yeah? Who won the first Fight, then?
I hit a home run?
Heh!  Sounds like you been doin' some serious dreamin' under that anesthetic.
NOTHING CAN UNDO WHAT YOU'VE DONE!
Game's been ruined too long by hickety-hi dip wiggers and their muffin toppin' AWOL babysitter chicacitas, you ask me.
Yes, I'll put Roast Beef on the line, mom.  Sheesh.
I...I think I did, dude! Daaamn! Look at this man!
I can even have it write in the style of a famous author! Here, I'll priint up a few samples for you.
They comp me a suite and a silk lobster bib,
Well, everybody else has been lately, it seems.
(thought bubble) Huh...what should I yell...Wait, what direction do I go in, even? Crap, dude.
Holy crap! I can't find out what any of this crap is! Shit, man! Aren't there like three different sorts of bible? Or seven? But one of them is Jewish? Man, I ain't gonna be able to make this cake! Mom will know if I disobey that one about the yeast! Fuck!
Think so.
(thinks) Oh man no no he ain't got to do this twice in one night!
We were hell of sad we had no manes, dogg!  Our ancestors did!
Why should the Fight get to say how the Fight is won or lost? Become the ruling body, dude!
You bring the ketchup?
Hey look at that, Beef!  They got one 'a them little dancin' Santas!
Vlad, you're a machine, yet you could not identify which of your machine brothers was, in fact, the car quiz's logical choice.
"Brad: Party of One."
Uhh, hello?  Who's calling?
I'm walkin' around in the woods workin' on a new song, dogg!
So, like, you know me. Ain't never been too much into the vegetarian thing. But check this out, I was over at Mayor C's last night, and he grilled up these portobello mushroom kebabs? Man, that stuff tasted INSANE. I had no idea you could get that kind of flavor from a mushroom. I'm thinkin' of doin' some tonight if you want to hang around.
So now when you want to end the french, you just pull back and go MMM-*MMM!*
Like $5.99!  I was the only bidder!
Be sure to tell me what you think.  I don't even know if this was the right thing to do.
Ok, good! OH, let me fix us a drink first!
This is Uncle Ray knockin' at the door of One Cuddleplace Lane! Who wants dinner!
Roast Beef!  Good news!  I found Philippe, dude!
Tina?! What ... ?
Maybe we could send it in and get our own makeover show!
Dang, this feels good... It's like... Q-Tip good...
Man, has it been a while!
It's Ray, man! Show me some love, dogg!
Google.
The whoosy-whatsit?
Oh! Hey! I had an amazing dream!
Hey dudes! Did you see Tina walkin' around here with an old man last night?
aww yeah Vidal Sassoon do it to me one more time
Apparently he doesn't have good control, you know? So he wears a disguise and uses other peoples' bathrooms!
(Over Phone) I'm in a bad place, Beef. I screwed somethin' up pretty big, actually. Rally 'round a brother?
How you doin', Pat? Ten minutes to SHOWTIME!
You want to go to Hunan Palace and get Dong Ting Triple Delight? Yeah, man, I said it! Two knuckleheads, three delights!
Yeah-It's hilarious!
And he only talks outta a computer?
Say, Pat? Ray here. Shutup shutup. You got a number for that Nice Pete character?
I cut myself!
[[thinking]] Daaamn.
Alright now, that's it!  You are off to your room!
I got the directions right here...it's pretty well hid...
We just call him Roast Beef.  We all friends, you know?  Ain't that right, fellas?  *We all friends!*
Yo, T!  Beef's proposin' to Molly!
Yeah! Yeah! Lots of hot sauces say they're extreme, but none really take you outside of your moral comfort zone!
Well, I figure that since the lady is about to get spanked it might be worth more to certain--
Come on now, Beef! You represent the ideal modern male!
Uh... it's like... Beef... Beef is a good guy. A GOOD guy. Not the best, but then, you don't want that, because if he WAS he'd probably commit suicide in such a way that doctors could harvest all his organs and his skin.
These guys don't know this, but I got a special softball bat. To make today a thing.
Teodor, we hoped you would shine during the cooking event, but you folded with a focus and intensity normally seen only in successes.
Heh...old people. They cherish *everything.*
Not your place to judge. You a ho of some pretty spendy smokes, if I need to say that.
I... what was that all about, man? Women ain't talk that way!
Gimme a Japanese dude gettin' arrested for throwin' up panty-hose at a city meeting, or a German who gets so bored by his haircut that he dies, but leave the Poles alone.
He'd be all like, "THOU SHALT NOT KILL ANYBODY! ESPECIALLY NOT MEEEEE!"  And then he'd totally glare at the Italians, who would hide their skewers and pancetta.
...Yeah, you're right. I guess I shouldn't be down on the Chinese for just tryin' to survive. Makes me seem small.
Okay Rod, I'm gonna say something, and you just do whatever comes to mind, dig? Ahem... "There is no false power in the universe."
Hey, nice shirt! I used to like the Scorpions too!
There you are, you little creep!
It's a good costume, man! It symbolizes a clown!
Hey Pat, stock market been treatin' you well?
All that's missin' is the retired band teacher with the self-inflicted gunshot wound!
Beef, it don't stop there. This layout also has a *water feature*.
I get to drivin' over there, and in the middle of this huge flat field, there's an intersection with a stoplight. The light's red, and in the car in front of me the driver is checkin' his teeth in the rear-view mirror.
You're sellin' yourself toupees. Let's go hit the Smoke.
Well, yeah, but you won't be in the Mile High Club.
Listen, man! You know how I agreed to stop callin' the police over your animatronic nativity scene?
Can today's sex position just be that one where I'm alone in the bathroom with the water runnin' again?  I struck out down at Clancy's.
What's she doin' these days, anyway? Maybe I can use her as an example of how Goths don't succeed in the world.
There! Perfect. It ain't get more Beef than that!
Heh! Check it out, Beef - we're behind one of those dudes who messes with the letters on his Toyota!
Vegas. The Talented Dr. Sniffles just gave his bad self a whale tail-ectomy on the sharpened corner of an Emeril Lagasse franchise. Back in three.
Okay, where'd you put it?  You pack it with the snacks?
We goin' on a road trip, Beef!
If you're tryin' to be funny, maybe use a little less Vietnam. Old stand-up trick.
What?  Huh?  I don't get it.
Yo, dogg! Some moussaka would really hit the spot! All with that sauce...
Man, there is some gunk in here!  It's all like dried and stuff!
Well
Sure it sounds impressive, but when are you actually gonna use it?
Dude, I just wanted to make sure you didn't think I was homophobic at you or anything, now that you're outta' the closet.
Heh! Now that you got a steady lay, this should come in pretty handy!
Hey Beef, check it out! This guy has a website of himself gettin' shot in the head! They say it's the first one!
I am the son of Dr. John Worhabus, the prominent entomologist from whose collection most of Roast Beef's DNA was harvested.
One up front and one when the job is done.
A 1983 Mercedes? You got it, my friend. Anything else?
Yeah, exactly what I'm thinkin'!
Daaaaamn
Check this out!
Oh, you're right.  I guess I been meanin' to learn a little geometry.
Hey, dammit!  We TALKED about this!
Yes... I believe I will start with the Consomme a la Bohemienne.
Dude, of course you're gonna have your wedding and reception at my digs! Are you crazy? It's gonna save you twenty dillion clams! My Friday party got much of the infrastructure anyhow, and plus I expense it all for Prime Time!
Sorry, Beef. After the Philippe contract fell through, we were forced to make some pretty tough cutbacks.
Yeah ... yeah, I think I do.
That one's actually for singin' through.
Oh, yeah, that's one of my investments. Go ahead and deposit it.
Are you sure you're ready?
Oh, damnit. Hold on a second now! That ain't funny!
Talk about something you don't serve with a chilled rosé.
Roast Beef! You gotta get down here, dogg!
I said helicopter blades should have razor-sharp edges!
Oh come on now.  We all got our ideas.
How much Aqua Net did you have to use to get those two locks of hair to always line up all perfect on either side of your eye?
You know what? If he makes it back here...
Are you trying to be funny with me?
Gentlemen, we must share our discovery with the world. It is in the spirit of the highest good.
If you think about it, bein' in bed as long as possible is the healthiest thing I do each day.
The terrorists are like "Look, our guys haven't had a good chuckle in days.  We'll let you go if you stand in front of this American flag and drink cheap tea with your keister."
Did you ever see that fake ad from the 70s where Jose Cuervo just beats the hell out of a pinata shaped like his own brain?
Now Beef, a fried food item will only stay crispy for a short while!  This is due to the==
Jimi, man, wake up. Lay on your side, man. I ain't care if it goes all over the carpet. Just get those reds out, get that nasty old Ripple out.
I...
Hee hee!
Like seven!
Nah, Lyle just dropped off somethin' stronger-
God DAMN. Brilliant, Rod. Just brilliant. This man could find work on Mars, people.
Dang.  I get Connie donked and ruttin' in a nice guest room with a shower and fresh sheets, he's never gonna turn me down again when I put a nine-ball hundo on the rail!
Ah friends.
You're all played out, Marmaduke! You're all washed up! No one gets why you're still around! People whisper about this to each other!
I don't want any of this!
You salute your men, about-face, and drop trou.  Orlando Bloom plays you in the movie.
Mouth Mace! Daaamn! Maybe it's time we got into the hot sauce game! All you need is the right marketing, Beef. Seriously.
It goes through a tunnel! But even better is that when it gets to the hopper, it actually drops off tiny little payloads! Soooooo realistic!
You want a guy in a wheelchair crashin' through a wall, Beef?
Fun! Rad!
Is he...is he mixed race?
Let's go.  We'll talk in Airwolf.
Damn, Vlad! That... that really is the only way two actual guys can call each other on the phone without comin' over all, "I think about you".
Pat! What I tell you! Crashes! Wrecks! A child's pink Converse on the pavement...is there a foot inside? The police walk up the mother's driveway! I'm serious!
[[thinking to himself]] How in the heck did Pat get out of prison?
My other friend said I should write a poem about it as a way of therapy. So here it is.
What, this? Yeah, it's just my new Rolex.
So anyway, I had to delete something called the "Adobe Gamma Loader.exe"? Apparently that thing totally sucks!
i got to do this ...
Alright!  Alright Already!  Is this place any good?!
Uh, yeah, mom! I was just lookin' at it! Maybe... maybe I could make you some 'a this stuff for Easter brunch!
Hell yes the leeches were part of that favor!
He said he wanted somethin' with his name and some wings and stuff. Can you do that?
God DAMMIT!  Why the hell I got to see a Magreaux dog right now?!  Everything was FINE!
No it ain't.  Let's say Al Qaeda needed a little video to give its troops a boost, and you were one of like six U.S. hostages.
