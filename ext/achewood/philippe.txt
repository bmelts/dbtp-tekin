 What?
 I don't want to be mean to Pat!
 You must be Santa's dad!
 My mother knew that I would die some day!
 No, I mean what would the baby look like?
 It's official that I put my hand over my heart on the way up, right?
 W-Why?
 I will love you forever, seven dollars!
 One...two...three...
 There you go!  What do you think?
 Everyone likes Todd!
 Boy, is this guy talky!  When are we gonna get to the Super-Secret Ice Cream Shop already?!
 They never find a dead person with a wrench in his head.
 Neat! What's he do?
 Oh boy! What's it for?
 Oh, uh...Mozart! I want to be smart like Mozart!
 At first I thought tacos would be fun, but that's probably what he'll have on the plane ride up.
 They never find a dead person on Antiques Road Show.
 [[snaps fingers]] > Aw, why learn Chinese just to go bug a guy! Let's don't and say we did!
 Lie Bot, what's the saddest thing?
 Yes! Yes!
 I guess one  time my mom told me I had to stop reading my favorite book and go to bed and in my head I thought up a real sad piano song that I would ask my best friend to play at my funeral...
 oof

 Speaking of shooting... Sure, it's easy to shoot fish in a barrel, but I prefer to shoot fish in a tuxedo. I think people appreciate that extra level of professionalism.
 Oh, I see!
 We had to use a spatula.
 I'm coming, couch! I still love you! People care about you! You were always our friend! You matter!
 Oh, shoot! I forgot a can opener for the pork and beans.
 Good!
 Aaaiiiiie!
 Good job, everyone!
 It's mine!  I bought it!  I paid a thousand smackaroos!
 I know!  It's important!
 I like life!
 Bye bye Stanley!
 Please take our number off your list.  Goodbye.
 Oh boy! It looks just like my drawing! Thank you, Lyle!
 They're throwing it awway?! Nooo! NOO! They can't!
 AHEM... Tonight is a new beginning! tonight is the first night of...
 Who's there?
 [[is waking up in his bed]] >
 What does this do?
 SSSH!
 Lyle, do you want to write for my newspaper?
 What am I supposed to eat?
 "I truly believe that there is somebody out there for everyone ... just standing there ... waiting for the house to go dark..."
 Oh really? OH REALLY?!
 [Jumps] BUTT!
 How about Todd?
 [On phone] Hi Mom! Thank you for Walk-Around Butt! It's perfect!
 I have to get to the transfer station!  I have to...I have to find my friend!
 I AM THE SHERIFF OF THE DUMP! TELL ME WHERE THE OLD COUCHES GO!
 > I like to marry things I find
 Lyle! Hey! Where did you go to?!
 I do.
 EEEAUGH!
 Oh... oh no! Is... do you think the flower is mad with me?
 Jeez, Billy... sometimes I think I might be the worst person for your soul to be in!  I don't seem to know anything about punk rock!
 Hi Ray!
 Really?
 [[wearing a halo]] I...I just wanted to say thank you for being God and for making my life good! I'll miss it, but I'm glad I'm here with You.
 But don't worry, they're not too fast on land--
 But...but it trusted us, and it was always there for us, and we threw it away!
 (thought) Oh my gosh!  what about Petunia and the baby?
 It's a friend for kids who are alone most of the day!
 This is turning out good!
  You called yourself a "Cyber-punk" just because you had an e-mail address?
 That's illegal!
 H-How come?
 b...bye couch...I love you! I'll always remember you!
 They do?
 But you just ate one! I saw!
 Huh! Okay, how about this...
 Say you're sorry! This one was my favorite!
 How come I'm not falling? Am I on a cloud? What if...what if I died and I'm in heaven? Maybe God lets you skip the scary part of dying...I should thank him if he has time to meet with me...
 How come you're looking out the window so much today, TÃ©odor?
 Wait a minute!  Where do they get the baby?
  Princess Philippe and Underpants Dan are gonna save...
  Bachelor Party?  What's that?
 Oh boy! It's Friday! Egg and cheese muffin day! I'm -
 Ha ha! Yeah, of course you can!
 Cowboys!
 I...I think so, this time.
 AAAAAAA!
 AAAA!
 Start a fire for the pope, at once!
  This is my Halloween costume!
 (sings) "What's a guy to do!"
 Now it's your turn.
 Oh boy!  I can sit with you guys?
 Wow, a banjo! Will you play me a song, Teodor? Please? Pretty pleeease!
 How come?
 I just saw Harry Potter and I'm too scared to go to sleep.
 Really?!
 What does this make?
 Yarr!  There be hugs and kisses this way!
 Oh! Good! I can do installments!
 I just saw Harry Potter and I'm too scared to go to sleep!
 I really thought that flower was pregnant!
 Oh no! I'm under attack by cods! Oh my goodness!
 I can't believe I won the competition to meet the Beach Boys. They're my favourite band in the whole world.
 Lyle! Are you going into your room to smoke heated-up marijuana?
 Ultra Peanut!  So that was your name!  You know, I felt kind of rude that I never --
 "If Jesus was a dog, would he wear a cape and walk on two legs?"
 Yo mama's so fat, she broke her leg and hot bloody fat sprayed everywhere!  Some even got on the mayor!
 I, PHILIPPE, LIKE LIFE!
 Ha ha!
 Is... is there any way to save it?
 Mr. Bear, who is better- Emeril or Jesus?
 Hooray! Thank you!
 I guess I did...
 It's the Little Kid Message Board! It's the message board where kids can say what kids have to say!
 Téodor, where do you think they took the couch today?
 Mr. Bear, what would happen if a chicken mated with a dog?
 FRANCES!  Why isn't the baby breathing?!  Can't you hear me?  Frances!  WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?!
 Sounds good!  I'll be inside if you need me.
 Instead of dessert, English people call it "pudding." This works really well if you're trying to lose weight.
 Yes! Good!
 Saaa-a-ay!  How come your thingy is stickin' out like a screwdriver handle?  Mine never did that yet!
 See warranty for details.  Not intended for children over nine.
 Yes mom!  I was just about to play them.
 Mr. Bear, who's better - Emeril or Jesus?
 Lie Bot!  What are you doing in that bush?
 Really, Lie Bot?
 If a chicken mated with a dog!  You know!  What would happen?
 Will you turn on the lights please Billy?
 Ray! Look! The police are at your house!
 I... I just wanted to hear him make his bathroom sound again!
 Téodor is taking a nap.
 Yeah! And we used ground-up aspirin and lemon juice to erase the postmarks!
 A snake rode a motorcycle seven miles!
 Who's on your show today?
 Children are special!
 "M-M-Molly, c-c-can I ask you a question about Jesus?"
 YEAH! HA HA HA! VERY GOOD!
 Maybe I'll just hold my breath until I die!
 Who ate all the honey-roasted peanuts I left on the coffee table?! I was looking forward to having some when I came inside!
 Ray, can I have fifty cents for a Skor bar from the vending machine?
 --oh my goodness! Is this...the olympics?
 [Looks inside of Walk-Around Butt's buttcrack]
 Oh boy! The Advisor answered my letter! Oh, good!
 Wow! What's that?
 Al Pacino is in Teodor's room?! Oh my gosh!
 Oh, I dunno. Extra stuff?
 Mr Bear, I think I have a stomach ache.
 Hello! I am happy to talk to---
 Lie Bot, how does Chinese Water Torture work?
 Hello, America. Good Morning. How are you.
 You're absolutely right, dear Pope! I am dedicated to improving morals!
 Gay folks?
 Hello! I need a hug! Wake up! Do you have Dora? I can't visit animals because there is a lice alert! I need to poop! I have a joke about a canary: He was hanging upside-down! Ha ha! Does God have a car?
 ...how did you know!
 Who's Sir Cuss-a-lot?
 One minute!
 Hi Ray!  We need to take care of homeless people!
 Heya, Lie Bot! Wanna watch me dig a hole?
 [On other end] No, I did not, mom!
 Oh boy! Wow!
 Oh boy! It came!
 Oh wow! Really?!
 If you can do a good job, that would be nice.
 I'm sorry!  Oh no!  I'm so sorry!
 What, Mr. Bear?
 I'm studying about my family!
 GO AWAY!
 Gosh, how do you commit suicide? Maybe if I eat lots of super-hot chili sauce...
 No. I can't let him do it. What's the number of the radio show?
 SNIF
 It's so soft!  It's like having a new baby lamb!
 Wow! Phew.
 I don't need to! Everyone in the house can smell when you do it even though you have that dumb invention that you think works!
  I... I'm sorry I dishonored you, Click Robot!
 I promise!
 Holy mackerel, that's right!
 Huh.
  I don't get it, Billy!  How come I have to say so many cusses?
 Oh boy! It's Walk-Around-Butt!
 Aww, I don't suppose I should ask for nothin'!  Life's been pretty good to me.
 Let's...let's see when Santa Claus was born!
 I get more money from sending him letters that he can read in the bathroom!
 Stop it!  It's totally rad!  Just listen!
 Oh!  Better take me with you.  I want to pray.
 Knock knock!
 I must be on the spout of a giant whale! When he stops blowing, I'll fall hundreds of feet and break my neck!
 Will you put all the dressings into bowls with different ladles?
 Okay!
 Wow! What's this Ray?
 You have to hit it to this end!
 [Looks in butthole]
 Oh! We should also make sure he wipes his shoes before he comes in the house.
 I think I'm at that special aaaaage!
 HEEELLLP!
 Saaaay, why's the couch in the front hallway? Crazy!
 That's not true!  A guy from the internet gave me a thousand bucks to have dinner with him!
 Don't make my car call me a fag! That is very rude!
 There should be a place where they can shave and go potty!
 Ladies and Gentlemen, I command your attention!
 There is a sale on Cadillacs!
 Ray! Mark Twain doesn't want to know about that kind of thing! Be polite!
 Hello, this is Philippe!  I am happy to talk to you!
 Okay, but only if you think you're brave enough!
 It's Democrats and Republicans, right?
  Don't listen to him, Dan!
 Hi Mr. Bear!
 What do you mean? It's going to someone else's house?
 You think I'm funny?
 I mean, it sorta makes sense... all the pollen and stuff, and that birds and bees story...
 ah, here we go-"Make Bathroom".
 How about Todd?  Todd's funny.  Everyone likes Todd!  Let's use Todd!
  Oh, boy!  Let's practice!
 What if C.O.P.S. came and everyone was yelling at you? You'd feel bad then!
 My ear hurts, Roast Beef! Since yesterday!
 What did you get Téodor for his birthday?
 So, are you RoughBoy99 or pants_come_off?
 It's a Tommy the Tummy!  Isn't it cool?
 Ahem.  Baby Llewellyn cannot eat a carrot for several years.
 Okay Téodor
 Who ate all the honey-roasted peanuts I left on the coffee table?!
 They put a drinking fountain for dogs in the bathroom! What a neat decision!!
 We're into education now.
 Oh boy! What is it what is it!
 No! Lie Bot taught me how to do a break-dance move! Watch!
 You're welcome!
 It was super-expensive to make the book, and it is a huge money-loser!
 I made you one that says you're 65 so you can get the retirement breakfast at Denny's!
 Pranks?
 Who be wantin' to know!
 Like with Bad Morals?
 Do you think you can make some cakes and hamburgers and stuff?
 I'm -
 Yeahhh, I think I might be a little taller... So what's new at home?
 They tell us not to judge a book by its cover, but what if the building's on fire? Don't be a hero, man - just do it and get out.
  Good point!  We'd better go... to the DOCTOR!
 Phew!
 Oh boy.  I couldn't ask Al Pacino to pay me back for eating those peanuts!  He would think I was small-time!
 Wow! Thank you for the free toothbrush! Oh my gosh, it even has your phone number on the side! That way I can Consult you in times of crisis!
 Is... is he in pain?
 or take way too hot of a shower?
 Fajinal...vandig...gul...what?
 > I guess that I'm retarded But what's a guy to do-
 What's a Stem Cell?
 Wow, I get to take a shower with a band? Totally cool!
 Oh...I see. Well, here goes nothing. I guess. If I mess up and get too mean, You can have my Action Rangers.
 Th- This flower is going to die in the winter, Mr. Bear?
 You didn't have to lie to him! He was so nice to us!
 RAP MUSIC, MY DROOGS!
 It's from mom!
 Ha ha!  I guess you do look just like a skater!
 Maybe digging this hole wasn't such a good idea after all.
 Two birds with one stone!
 > "What's a guy to do!"
 Can...can he do it again?
 I want to be a comedian! Mr. Bear, how do I come up with my own jokes?
 I even tried to get the last notes to sound like,
 I'll pour boiling gravy into my eyes! That oughta do me in!
 TÃ©odor! Guess what I learned today!
 Let's pretend it works!
 (sings) I like to marry things I find I'm glad that I found you!
 Ooh!  What?
 Lyle, will you read me a bedtime story?
 Philippe!  See, that's me.
 But...but his mom was nice to him, right?
 I bet so!
 I don't have a big vocabulary.
 I need to find the Q-tips.
  Which one's better?
 "They say that genius is ninety-nine percent perspiration, so I wrote to Stephen Hawking and asked that he never come and sit on any of our couches!"
 What are you reading, Lyle?
 I just exercised and ate healthy!
 Watch!
 [Singing, wearing butt] Walk-Around Butt! When you wear it, you're a nut!
 I think everyone wants to see some new ideas!
 What? Really? You did?
 Let's see... sheriff's bady, pork and beans, ladle... all set!
 Ha ha! Don't thank me, thank Anarchy!
 GO AWAY! GO AWAY STUPID CODS!
 I can't wait to try it out! YES!
 Oh boy!
 Hi Lyle!
 Is Antiques Road Show on?
 Hmm...
 Do a trick! Pleeease!
 Could he even be in the computer?
 Oh my goodness! How convenient!
 NO!
 It's been here since I have! I always play and read my books on it!
 Good Morning!
 And they win a free George Foreman grill!
 But Billy Idol!  Why did your soul go into me?
 Sperm!  Oh, you mean Magic Gravy!
 No!
 Don't litter, Lyle!
 Todd's funny.
 That's marvelous!
  I fold
 Is it... is it Jesus?
 And you can create fun explosions at Kmart by filling the paint shaker up with big bottles of soda!
 Look Lyle!  My mom got me an electric guitar!
 Yes!
 But, mother! Without the contribution of the entire cast, Achewood wouldn't be the unique blend of humor and camaraderie that we all know and love!
 (thought) I'll be a two-timer!  I'll go to hell!
 And today in Sports!  ...ahem... Washington safety Curtis Williams always smiled, even confined to a wheelchair, paralyzed from the neck down...
 I should start a newspaper!
 But Ray!
 Yeah! It never happened! Lyle can prove it!
 Frances!  What a pretty name!
 Which one's better?
 I'm more confused than before!
 Oh, I see!  Thanks, Lyle!
 Yes it is. Okay, I look forward to receiving the piano music in a few days.
 Oh, boy!
  TÃ©odor!  Mr. Bear read My Side of the Mountain to me!  I'm going to live on my own in the backyard!
 Did you know that McDonald's is the best place to use counterfeit money?
 Can we listen to the Ford Trucks song?
 How fun!
 Well, how do you like it up here?
 If we throw it away it will feel so hurt and lonely!
 Can you please please PLEASE turn the lights on?!  I'm scared of the dark!
 Yeah...
 Cool!
 Oh, I don't know...
 What do you do with the History folder?
 It is a perfect... logo!
 He's just cussing!
 Hello? Oh, hi mom! How are you? Huuugs!
 [Opening Package] Oh boy! It's Walk-Around-Butt!
 It's just a general purpose meeting so we can meet each other.
 REALLY?!
 How obvious!
 These don't sound like bedtime stories! Don't you know any?
 Wow!
 (thinking) Better not... too risky...
 Oh my gosh! Is he okay?
 But I thought EVERYBODY cried during Finding Nemo!
 Do you work at the circus?!
 That's right, Pat! I would like to earn your vote!
 Talk about fresh!
 But I thought men couldn't have babies!
 Oh boy oh boy! Can I look now?
 What? Now you want to climb a tree? You sure have a lot of dreams for a french fry!
 No I didn't!
 Oh. So not like this drawing?
 Wha--? What's happening?
 Lyle's record player needs cleaning...a-ha!
 Hello?
 TÃ©odor, how do you say "potatoes"?
 [Reaches inside]
 Yaaaay!
 Let's use Todd!
 Who?
 A screaming person!
 Wow! What's this, Ray?
 (thinking) Ouch... Ouch... Ouch... Ouch...
 MY FATHER ONCE KNEW A MAN!
 Huh? What's a bidet?
 Oh no! If I take office, it will be like murdering Mickey Mouse!
 Lie Bot, what is the saddest thing?
 Hello, dear Pope! Would you like a seat near the window?
 I...I just wanted to say thank you for being God and for making my life good! I'll miss it, but I'm glad I'm here with You.
 You are seven dollars!  Yes you ARE!  Yes you ARE!
 Am... Am I... dead?
 Oh no!  They found a dead person!
 Hey, that's RIGHT!
 Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go to my room.
 You had a Three Musketeers and you were sticking peanuts into it!
 Phew! I really thought that flower was pregnant!
  What, Mr. Bear?
 Lie bot, do other people really want to kill Americans?
 "I went to a doctor for help getting rid of my athelete's foot, but they just yanked it away and threw me in jail..."
 He would think I was small-time!
 No opinion! [singing]
 Mom, guess what! I'm calling you from a pay phone...
 Oh...oh no! Is...do you think the flower is mad with me?!
 Heya, Lie Bot! Wanna watch me dig a hole? Lie Bot: You know, if you dig that hole deep enough, you'll come out in China! Philippe: Really!? Lie Bot: I ga-ron-tee! Philippe: That's marvelous! Lie Bot: 35 Hsu-Giang Road, Guangding Prefecture 5070, Szechuan Province. You will emerge beneath the bed of Dr. Quang-Hai Li, an important yet violent dictator. Philippe: Oh my gosh! I'll get tortured! Lie Bot: If he's at work at the time, you may be able to escape to the street and cobble together a live of basic slavery. Philippe: Maybe digging this hole wasn't such a good idea after all. Lie Bot: On the other hand, if you present yourself well, you could convert him to Americanism and save thousands of lives! Think this one out, kid.
 But when do we act bad?
 Oh, boy! Maybe we can solve a crime!
 Yeah! Scared but important!
 UGGH! STUPID FRIDGE! STUPID HEAVY FRIDGE! STUPID JERK FRIDGE!
  Hi Teodor!  One custom baseball card of me, please!
 These are my new Speaker Sneakers!  My mom sent them to me!
 My mother knew that I would die one day!
 OK. I am interested in getting piano CDs.
 I'm sorry!  Please don't be mad!  I didn't know!
 W-What do you collect?
 Excuse me, Lie Bot. I have to use the bathroom.
 It's been here ever since I have! I always play and read my books on it!
 I don't mind! Everybody should get a turn!
 "They say that eating an apple a day keeps the doctor away ... but throwing it at him works better!"
 I know!
 But...but you don't need anybody new! You already love Dad! I know he's in Heaven now! But...but...
 This is turning out great!
 Lie Bot, I can't sleep. Will you tell me a fairy tale?
 Let's see-how'd she do that...
  Why don't they just make one party out of all the good things?
  Why don't they just make one party out of all the good things>
  Listen! A fire truck! What do you think happened, Lie Bot?
 BROWN COUCH!  BROWN COUCH!  BROWN COUCH!  PAY ATTENTION!
 Hi Roast Beef! Do you want to write for my newspaper?
 I'm almost done reading all of the Hardy Boys books! Is there a last one?
 Hey! He can be my political party mascot! Just like how Democrats have a donkey!
 Be careful, Ray! There might be machine guns!
 Oh my gosh, guys!  Thanks!
 Lyle also taught me how to make a fake ID!
 Well how come you used to call yourself a "Cyber-punk," then?
 You may NOT speak about my mother that way! Pope, you are no longer welcome in my country!
 but today I am ending the Mafia.
 This isn't working at all!
 Pistachios!
 Is this okay?
 Wow, seven dollars!
 You write your own Harry Potter legends TOO?! Can I see? You can read mine!
 See you later!
 I was looking forward to having some when I came inside!
 Do...do you have any... Vicodin?
 "Wow! You are a good artist, Molly! Can we show that he has been eating chocolate?"
 Here.
 Wow yes please I mean, if I could!
 [[stares at the computer. Displayed in a giant monitor window with scroll bars behind him is the following information
 We buried french fry today, Ray.
 Huuugs!
 Roast Beef! Look! I'm a bumble-bee!
 A screaming person out in the street!
 Thank you Roast Beef!
 Oh, boy. I couldn't ask Al Pacino to pay me back for eating those peanuts!
 Mr. Bear, what will the rest of my life be like?
 Dear God: for my birthday, please let Ray not be afraid of heights any more.  He is my friend, and I promise that he is good.
 Why not, Lie Bot?
 Yeah, I think everybody wishes they could fly.  It's impossible, though.
 Hello, this is Philippe!  I am delighted to talk to you!
 [Delighted] Pistachios!
 LYLE! You did potty on my very last kids' book!
 Ha ha!  What show is this?
 I can do that!
 That little tube you try to hide the smoke in! I saw you do it once!
 Oh boy!  My mom sent me an I Am Capable Of Wonderful Things doll!
  But that was just you and me!  There wasn't even any music playing!
 huuuuugs
 I'm sorry that I didn't like you, little guy.
 Mr. Bear?
 Women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have, but cockroaches are born pregnant... I think we know who's winning that game...
 Okay. Boy, I sure wish Todd didn't do all those cocaines.
 I don't even want Vicodin, Todd!  All I want is nachos!
 Cornelius!  A pleasing dance for King Phillipe, at once!
 Italian people are nice!
 {{thinking}} I want to be on the Wall of Tough Guys!
 Hi Vlad!
 I used an Anarchy Box!
 What? What's the problem, Lie Bot?
 Geology Greg from City College Community Minute says that marshes are where land and water meet! I'll just follow the creek!
 Yes. I agree.
 Chinese people are amazing.
 Ha ha! Hi Mr. Bear!
  Does UNIX have eBay?
 Ray, what does it mean that Pat is gay?
... the WORLD!
 I re-used the stamps to send you some pictures that I drew!
 [[still in his bed]] Oh boy! I wonder how many ladies wrote back to Roast Beef!
 Hiya, Lie Bot!
 What do you want me to do, Billy?
 Oh my gosh! I'll get tortured!
 Magnum P.I.!
 Did you get the horn to work the way we talked about?
 [[laughing]] Gosh! This was the couch's plan all along! That guy!
 Yeah, I guess it is pretty scary
 Oh Boy!  She's coming back!
 and I didn't even have to pay for it!
 Good! What issue would you like to chat about?
 Mr. Bear, what spell do you say to turn a turkey into a new baby boy or girl?
 It's because no one there cares what is happening!
 He's cussing!
 Will you marry me, Frances?
 Téodor: Orezscu is a friend of mine and he knows a ton about music! He said he would like to help me out with the Friday Facts page more in the future so maybe he will. What is "blew"?
 Okay. What will that do?
 What are you talking about? What is Homosexuals? That sounds like the name of a famous circus gorilla!
 Ladies and Gentlemen, please put your hands together for Homosexuals the Gorilla!
 Oh, uh...Mozart!  I want to be smart like Mozart!
 Lyle's cussing!
 Shucks.  It would be the perfect pet!  The un-bitey-ness of a chicken's head, and the "I don't want to cook that"-ness of a dog's body!  Everyone would be safe!
 I'm not coming down until I lose ten pounds!
 (singing) No opinion!
 [[Thinking to himself:]] What should he do? A good writer would know this.
 I want to go to Disneylaaand! I think I have to go to Disneylaaaaaaand!
 The...the couch! We need to save our old couch! It's on the barged headed for china!
 No... but I do have a pretty neat bicycle!  My mom--
 And, i think everyone agrees it's time this country was run by someone who is five!
 Hooray!
 Now where could Dennis be?
 Yaaay! Done!
 Because Jesus could turn loaves into fishes and feed a thousand people, but Emeril feeds that many people every day at his restaurant!
 I better tell him to get his dancing pants on!
 (sings) I guess that I'm retarded But what's a guy to do-
 My life is special!
 "Oh boy!"
 TÃ©odor! Look what my mom sent me!
 O...okay.
 Nooo!
 Really!?
 Carl, Al and big brother Brian are practising their harmonies.  All sounding nice!
 (to flower) I'm sorry flower!
 Wow!  Is it a boy or a girl?!  Is it okay?  What is its name?
 Oh, better make it five!  I was going to take some of the neighborhood kids to breakfast before work.
 Oh boy! I sure hope Cunty wins the town race! That's the only way the Mayor won't turn his pond into an apartment for ungrateful people!
 Well sure, I guess so...
 My weird neighbor came by and started shooting her mouth off... now she has to eat through a tube in her arm...
 Oh my gosh!  Did he not die all the way?  Do you have to finish killing him?
 Oh!  Yes!  I'm going to be a princess!
 TÃ©odor! What happened? Where am I?
 Siiick!
 [Still singing, wearing butt] Walk-Aroouuund...
  Say!  He could be my sidekick, like Ariel and Sebastian!
 No I'm not!  I'm not punk at ALL!
 Hey!
 On Antiques Road show they look at a picture or a vase and then they tell the person that is worth so much money that they will always be happy forever.
 Okay!  Say ideas!
 But that's mean! What if it hit him?
 What?  Why?
 Why don't they just make one party out of all the good things?
 Surely you can see how a guy could get confused!
 Al Pacino is in TÃ©odor's room?!  Oh my gosh!
 It bothered you, and it bothered us.
 Oh boy! It's Friday! Egg and cheese muffin day!
 Who's they?
 But how come?
 Wow! Like people who can see ghosts, or the future! There should be a movie about Pat's ability!
 "OK".
 Like...in a mean way?
 Sure I am!  I've been practicing.
 > I guess that I'm retarded
 [[looking critical]] Superman wouldn't wear a police hat in the shower! Applesauce!
  Gosh! Do you think so?
 The Anarchy Cookbook is amazing!
 In there!
 Let's... let's see when Santa Claus was born!
 Oh my gosh!
 They're probably six feet long!
 Can you peek at my newest ideas? I...I'm gonna...I'll be right back.
 Boy, this creek goes on for EVER! I better start camping before it gets too late!
 But it's true, Ray! People should know!
 Lyle, what is the story of the birds and the bees?
 Ha ha! Yeah, I guess I am a little retarded!
 Lie Bot, do other people really want to kill Americans?
 From...from when you had your...wisdom teeth out?
 Um... Okay...
 [[happy]] Oh, you aren't kidding! He was amazing!
 Please mommy I'm sorry for being disrespectful please not the BUCKLE MOMMY NOT THE BUCKLE!
 (Thinks) Oh my gosh! I could go deaf? Oh noooooo!
 W-what?
 No cussing!
 I am not boring! I learned how to cook tacos today!
 > I like to marry things I find I'm glad that I found you!
 Like this?
 I wonder if Mr. Wizard ever boiled shit! I better go on YouTube!
 What do you mean?  It's going to someone else's house?
